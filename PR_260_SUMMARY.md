## 🚀 Optimizations I've Added

I identified and fixed hardcoded color values that didn't respect theme changes:

### CSS Variables System

**Problem**: Components had hardcoded colors like `#11111198`, `rgba(56, 55, 57, 1)`, etc.

**Solution**: Added CSS variables and updated all components to use them.

**Changes**:
1. Added new CSS variables to `index.css`:
   - `--dropdown-bg` and `--dropdown-hover`
   - `--message-user-bg` and `--message-agent-bg`
   - `--header-bg` and `--header-border`

2. Updated components:
   - `DropdownMenu.tsx` - Now uses CSS variables for all colors
   - `ChatMessage.tsx` - Message bubbles use theme-aware colors
   - `ChatContainer.tsx` - Header uses CSS variables
   - `ChatInput.tsx` - Send button uses theme-aware color

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Colors automatically respect light/dark theme
- ✅ Centralized color management
- ✅ Better CSS optimization
- ✅ Easier maintenance

## 💡 Recommendations for Future

These are **non-blocking** suggestions for follow-up:

1. **Add E2E tests** for new dropdown menu interactions
2. **Document CSS variable system** in AGENTS.md
3. **Add JSDoc comments** to new TypeScript interfaces
4. **Extract remaining inline styles** to CSS classes
