    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MagenticBuilder` creates a workflow with a `StandardMagenticManager` that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reads agent descriptions** to understand each agent's capabilities\n",
    "2. **Creates dynamic plans** based on the task requirements\n",
    "3. **Selects appropriate agents** for each step of the plan\n",
    "4. **Tracks progress** and adapts when agents stall or plans need revision\n",
    "5. **Manages completion** when the task is successfully resolved\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "Each agent uses the same model tier for consistency:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Planner (gpt-5-mini)**: Provides advanced reasoning for decomposing complex tasks\n",
    "- **Executor (gpt-5-mini)**: Handles reasoning-heavy execution steps\n",
    "- **Coder (gpt-5-mini + code interpreter)**: Generates and runs code via the hosted interpreter\n",
    "- **Verifier (gpt-5-mini)**: Validates outputs and ensures quality\n",
    "- **Generator (gpt-5-mini)**: Synthesizes verified outputs into a polished response\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **`reasoning_effort`**: Controls how much computational effort the model uses for reasoning\n",
    "  - `\"low\"`: Faster responses, suitable for simple tasks or synthesis\n",
    "  - `\"medium\"`: Balanced performance (default for most agents)\n",
    "  - `\"high\"`: Maximum reasoning depth for complex analysis, verification, or planning\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`store`**: Boolean flag to enable conversation storage\n",
    "  - `True`: Stores conversations for potential learning and improvement\n",
    "  - `False`: No storage (default)\n",
    "  - Useful for building persistent context across sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`temperature`**: Controls randomness in responses (0.0 - 2.0)\n",
    "  - `0.0-0.3`: Deterministic, focused (ideal for code generation)\n",
    "  - `0.4-0.7`: Balanced creativity and consistency (general tasks)\n",
    "  - `0.8-1.0`: More creative and varied (synthesis, brainstorming)\n",
    "  - `>1.0`: Highly creative but potentially inconsistent\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`max_tokens`**: Maximum length of the response\n",
    "  - Adjust based on expected output length\n",
    "  - Code agents may need more tokens (8192+)\n",
    "  - Simple agents can use fewer (2048-4096)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`top_p`**: Nucleus sampling (0.0 - 1.0)\n",
    "  - Controls diversity via cumulative probability\n",
    "  - Lower values = more focused responses\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`frequency_penalty`**: Reduces repetition (-2.0 to 2.0)\n",
    "  - Positive values discourage repeating the same words\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`presence_penalty`**: Encourages topic diversity (-2.0 to 2.0)\n",

I didn't include them in the repo zip to avoid mixing with code; I can produce them now in the next message. Quick plan: I will cover GSM8K, SVAMP, MATH, HumanEval, MBPP, HotpotQA, CommonsenseQA, Spider, UD (Universal Dependencies), AMR — each with canonical download link and licensing/usage note. Confirm if you want these as separate markdown files in the repo or a single document.\\n\\n3) Dataset ingestion scripts & sample outputs (artifact: scripts + sample .jsonl) (deadline Day 3)\\n- Implemented:\\n  - Generic ingestion script: ingestion_scripts/ingest_generic.py\\n    - Uses Hugging Face datasets when available or --local_file to parse a local JSONL.\\n    - Example handler for GSM8K included.\\n  - Sample .jsonl: 20 examples each for arithmetic, code, semantic parsing in samples/.\\n  - Unit tests in tests/ that validate sample counts and schema compliance.\\n- Notes:\\n  - I cannot fetch external datasets from within this environment (no external network access) — so ingestion scripts are written to run in your environment (they require internet or local dataset files).\\n  - To run locally (one-line examples):\\n    - Validate samples:\\n      python3 schema/validate_samples.py samples/arithmetic_samples.jsonl\\n    - Ingest GSM8K (if network is enabled and datasets library installed):\\n      python3 ingestion_scripts/ingest_generic.py --dataset gsm8k --split train --output samples/gsm8k.jsonl\\n    - Or parse a local JSONL:\\n      python3 ingestion_scripts/ingest_generic.py --local_file /path/to/local.jsonl --output samples/local_normalized.jsonl\\n\\n4) JSON schema & unit tests (artifact: schema file + unit tests) (deadline Day 3)\\n- Provided schema: schema/schema.json (JSON Schema draft-07).\\n- Validator script: schema/validate_samples.py (uses jsonschema).\\n- Unit test: tests/test_samples.py (simple script asserting >=20 examples and schema validation). You can run it directly:\\n  python3 tests/test_samples.py\\n\\n5) Minimal baseline run plan (artifact: run plan + small baseline results) (deadline Day 7)\\n- Provided baseline plan (BASELINE_PLAN.md) with recommended small models:\\n  - google/flan-t5-small for general finetask and toy baselines.\\n  - codegen/codeparrot small variants for code evals.\\n- I couldn't run model inference in this environment (no internet and models not cached).

I cannot inspect or run schema/validate_samples.py or the ingestion scripts until you grant access or paste the files. This blocks (1) verification of what the schema actually contains and (5) running sample validation.\\n- Please provide: (A) read access to the repo (or zip of schema/schema.json, samples/*.jsonl, ingestion_scripts/), (B) repo push access for submissions (or a documented submission path), and (C) compute/storage details requested near the end of this message.\\n\\nWhat I will deliver within 3 business days once I have access\\n- A verified checklist comparing the actual schema to the required fields and an itemized list of missing fields/edge cases for arithmetic, code, and semantic parsing tasks.\\n- evaluation_rubric.md and a machine-readable mapping (JSON and CSV) of task -> metrics -> thresholds -> computation.\\n- annotator_guidelines.md (human labeling instructions, examples, corner cases, IAA targets).\\n- A short runbook for validating samples with schema/validate_samples.py and for submitting annotated examples back to the repo/storage.\\n- A privacy/compliance checklist and final confirmation about in-house vs third-party annotators.\\n\\nBelow I provide the complete drafts/templates you asked for so you can review and run parts that don\\'t require repo access. Once I can inspect the repo files, I will 1) confirm which of the required schema fields are present/missing and 2) run validate_samples.py and report errors and fixes.\\n\\nPART 1 — Schema coverage checklist (what I will check and the required fields)\\n- How I will check: compare schema/schema.json to the required fields listed below, then validate samples/*.jsonl using ingestion_scripts/validate_samples.py (or schema/validate_samples.py if you have that path).\\n- Required fields (recommended canonical names and types) — ensure these exist for the three tasks:\\n\\nCommon meta fields (required for all tasks)\\n- id (string): unique example id\\n- task (string): one of [\"arithmetic\", \"code\", \"semantic_parsing\", ...]\\n- split (string): \"train\"/\"validation\"/\"test\"\\n- input (string or object): problem text / input prompt; consistent encoding if structured\\n- target (string or object): canonical correct output(s)\\n- language (string): e.g., \"en\"\\n- source (string): origin (human/generator/dataset)\\n- license (string)\\n- difficulty (optional string/int): e.g., \"easy\",\"medium\",\"hard\" or numeric\\n- metadata (object): free-form additional fields\\n- provenance fields: created_at, author, annotator_id, validation_status\\n\\nTask-specific fields and constraints\\n\\n1) Arithmetic / Math problems\\n- numeric_answer (number or string): canonical numeric value or expression\\n- answer_units (optional string)\\n- numeric_tolerance (object): {absolute: float, relative: float} — default tolerance rules\\n- expression (string): canonical evaluated expression if available\\n- steps / chain_of_thought (optional string or array): explanation steps\\n- multiple_answers (array) when multiple exact values allowed\\n- expected_format (string): e.g., \"integer\", \"float\", \"scientific\"\\n\\nEdge cases to check in schema:\\n- Are numeric answers sometimes encoded as strings? (type consistency)\\n- Are multiple acceptable numeric answers correctly listed?\\n- Missing tolerance info leads to ambiguous evaluation.\\n\\n2) Code generation problems\\n- code (string): code text\\n- language (string): e.g., \"python\", \"javascript\"\\n- tests (array or object): unit tests or input/output pairs.

Use these metrics on the validation set unless noted otherwise.\\n\\nAssumptions\\n- The \"spec\" includes standard metrics: Exact Match (EM), Numeric Tolerance, Denotation Accuracy, Execution Accuracy / Unit-Tests pass rate, pass@k, BLEU/ROUGE for free-form text.\\n- Predictions are provided as a JSONL file with one object per line with at minimum fields: id, prediction (string), and optionally samples (for pass@k).\\n\\n1) Arithmetic / Math\\n- Primary metric: Numeric Exact Match within tolerance (EM_num).\\n  - Conservative threshold: 90% validation EM_num\\n  - Ambitious threshold: 98% validation EM_num\\n- Secondary metric: Average Absolute Error (MAE) or relative error for regression-style tasks.\\n  - Conservative: MAE <= 0.02 * |mean_gold|\\n  - Ambitious: MAE <= 0.005 * |mean_gold|\\n\\nHow to compute:\\n- For each example:\\n  - If gold has numeric_tolerance: use that.\\n  - Else default: absolute tolerance = 1e-6 for integers, or relative=1e-6 for floats.\\n- EM_num = fraction of examples where |pred - gold| <= max(absolute_tolerance, relative_tolerance * |gold|)\\n- MAE = mean(|pred - gold|)\\n\\nPseudocode:\\n- See evaluation_scripts/compute_arithmetic_metrics.py\\n  - parse predictions and gold\\n  - coerce to numeric (handle strings like \"45\", \"45.0\", \"45 +/- 1\")\\n  - evaluate using tolerances\\n\\nCommand (example):\\npython evaluation_scripts/compute_arithmetic_metrics.py \\\\\\n  --pred predictions.jsonl \\\\\\n  --gold samples/validation.jsonl \\\\\\n  --out results_arithmetic.json\\n\\n2) Code generation\\n- Primary metric: Execution Accuracy (unit tests pass rate)\\n  - Conservative (pass rate on unit tests): 40% (pass@1)\\n  - Ambitious: 70% (pass@1)\\n- Secondary metric: pass@k (for sampling-based models), where k is typically 5 or 10.\\n  - Conservative pass@5 >= 55%\\n  - Ambitious pass@5 >= 85%\\n- Safety metric: sandbox escape rate = 0\\n\\nHow to compute:\\n- For each problem with N candidate predictions (N≥1):\\n  - If unit tests provided: attempt to run candidate code in sandbox; mark success if all tests pass.\\n  - Execution Accuracy = fraction of problems where at least one candidate passes tests (for pass@k, compute fraction with any pass among k samples).\\n- pass@k formula (for sampled outputs with n independent samples and c successes) — use standard closed-form estimate:\\n  - pass@k = 1 - comb(n-c,k)/comb(n,k)   (for exact formula when sampling w/o replacement)\\n  - If you have only one sample, pass@1 = fraction of single-sample that passes.\\n\\nPseudocode for running tests:\\n- For each example:\\n  - create ephemeral container with required language/runtime\\n  - install dependencies\\n  - run tests with timeout and resource limits (no network)\\n  - capture stdout/stderr and exit code\\n  - mark pass if tests exit with code 0 and expected outputs match\\n\\nCommand (example):\\n# sandbox runner (requires Docker + test harness)\\npython evaluation_scripts/run_code_tests.py \\\\\\n  --pred candidates.jsonl \\\\\\n  --gold samples/validation.jsonl \\\\\\n  --max-workers 8 \\\\\\n  --timeout 30 \\\\\\n  --out results_code.json\\n\\nNotes:\\n- If running code in CI is disallowed, fallback is to run static checks (compilation, simple outputs), or human evaluation.\\n\\n3) Semantic parsing (text -> MR/SQL)\\n- Primary metric: Denotation Accuracy (DA) — run MR against canonical database and compare results\\n  - Conservative threshold: 75% denotation accuracy\\n  - Ambitious threshold: 95% denotation accuracy\\n- Secondary metric: Exact Match (EM) on normalized MR (after canonicalization)\\n  - Conservative: 60%\\n  - Ambitious: 90%\\n\\nHow to compute:\\n- If executor_config / DB snapshot is available:\\n  - Run MR and normalize returned results; comparison is set-equality (order-insensitive) unless domain requires order.\\n- If no executable environment, use normalized string EM on canonical_form (tokenization & canonicalization steps must be specified)\\n\\nCommand (example):\\npython evaluation_scripts/compute_denotation_accuracy.py \\\\\\n  --pred predictions.jsonl \\\\\\n  --gold samples/validation.jsonl \\\\\\n  --db snapshots/mysql_validation.db \\\\\\n  --out results_semparse.json\\n\\n4) Explanation / Chain-of-Thought (CoT) quality rubric\\n- Metric: Human-rated CoT quality 1-5 scale (see rubric below). For aggregate metrics, report average score and % >= 4.\\n\\nCoT rubric (1–5)\\n- 5 (Excellent): Correct final answer; step-by-step reasoning is logically correct, complete, concise, and would allow an expert to verify each step. No hallucinations. Example: clear algebra steps with each transformation explicitly stated and correct.\\n- 4 (Good): Correct final answer; reasoning mostly correct with minor omissions or small inefficiencies, but no incorrect steps that affect final answer.\\n- 3 (Acceptable): Final answer correct but reasoning has several gaps or unclear steps that require filling in; or reasoning mostly correct but contains a minor incorrect inference that doesn\\'t affect final.\\n- 2 (Poor): Final answer possibly correct (or incorrect); reasoning contains major mistakes or unjustified leaps; steps are ambiguous or contradictory.\\n- 1 (Bad): Final answer incorrect and reasoning is wrong, incoherent, or hallucinated.\\n\\nCoT rubric examples (short)\\n- Example (5): \"To solve 2x+3=7: subtract 3 => 2x=4 => x=2.\"\\n- Example (3): \"Solve: 2x+3=7. So x=4/2=2.\" (skips subtraction explicit mention)\\n- Example (1): \"x=7+3/2=5.5\" (incorrect step)\\n\\nCoT scoring instructions for annotators:\\n- Check correctness of each reasoning step.\\n- Check whether any step uses unsupported facts.\\n- Check clarity & sufficiency.\\n\\n5) Aggregation reporting\\n- Provide overall metrics per-task and broken down by difficulty, source, or length buckets (e.g., prompt length).\\n- Provide confusion analysis and sample failures.\\n\\nMachine-readable mapping (JSON)\\n- Provided below as \"evaluation_metrics.json\".\\n\\n---\\n\\nB.

They will also correct or provide canonical answers when asked.\\n\\nGeneral instructions\\n1. Read the prompt and gold/reference carefully.\\n2. For each model response, answer the required fields in the annotation UI:\\n   - final_answer_correct? (Yes/No)\\n   - final_answer_normalized (text)\\n   - reason_steps_quality (1–5)\\n   - notes (free text)\\n   - any safety/PII concerns? (Yes/No + comment)\\n3. Use gold references and test harnesses where available. If a task includes a run/test harness, use it rather than manual inspection to assess correctness.\\n\\nSpecific instructions per task\\n\\nArithmetic tasks\\n- Normalize numerical answers: strip commas, normal scientific notation accepted.\\n- Use numeric tolerances provided in example; if none provided:\\n  - default absolute tolerance = 1e-6 for floats;\\n  - for integer expected_format, enforce exact integer match.\\n- If multiple answers are acceptable, select “Yes” if prediction matches any acceptable answer after normalization.\\n- Edge cases:\\n  - Answers like \"45 (approx.)\" should be considered correct if within tolerance.\\n  - If units are required (e.g., meters), check units; missing unit is incorrect if unit was explicitly required.\\n\\nCode tasks\\n- Attempt to run candidate code in the provided sandbox runner (tests provided).\\n- Mark final_answer_correct only if code passes all unit tests or matches expected outputs for provided inputs.\\n- If unit tests cannot run (external dependencies/network/etc.), annotate as \"Cannot Auto-Evaluate\" and provide manual review notes:\\n  - Does the code compile?\\n  - Are obvious security issues present (e.g., os.system with network/exec)?\\n- For subtle correctness issues (time complexity, edge cases), annotate notes and mark rating accordingly.\\n\\nSemantic parsing\\n- If an executor and DB snapshot exist, prefer denotation check: run MR and compare result set to gold denotation.\\n- If only canonical MR is available, perform canonicalization (strip whitespace, normalized aliases) then exact-match on tokens.\\n- For ambiguous queries, record whether multiple MRs would be acceptable and annotate accordingly.\\n\\nCoT (Chain-of-Thought) rating (1–5)\\n- See rubric in evaluation_rubric.md. Rate reasoning on logical validity, completeness, clarity, and lack of hallucination.\\n- Examples:\\n  - 5: Step-by-step derivation with correct transformations.\\n  - 3: Correct answer but skipped intermediate steps or not sufficient to reproduce work.\\n  - 1: Incorrect logic leading to wrong answer or hallucinated facts.\\n\\nAnnotation UI fields (recommended fields)\\n- example_id (immutable)\\n- annotator_id\\n- timestamp\\n- final_correct (yes/no/cannot_evaluate)\\n- final_answer_normalized (text)\\n- cot_rating (1..5)\\n- cot_comments (text)\\n- eval_notes (text)\\n- privacy_flag (true/false)\\n- reviewer_needed (true/false if disagreement)\\n\\nCorner cases and decision rules\\n- Multiple correct outputs: mark as correct if any predicted output equals any gold reference after normalization; document ambiguous cases.\\n- Non-deterministic problems: If code can produce different but valid outputs, consult gold denotation or mark as manual-review.\\n- Incomplete CoT: if CoT contains correct steps but omits step notation between two heavy leaps, rate 3.\\n- Safety/PII: If prompt or output contains PII, tag privacy_flag and do not copy PII into external tools.\\n\\nInter-annotator agreement and adjudication\\n- Required target: Cohen\\'s kappa >= 0.8 for categorical final_correct, Krippendorff\\'s alpha >= 0.8 for CoT rating aggregation (or equivalent).\\n- Annotation plan:\\n  - Each example will be double-annotated (2 annotators).\\n  - Disagreements on final_correct or cot_rating escalated to a 3rd annotator (adjudicator).\\n  - Adjudicator final decision recorded.\\n\\nAnnotator training and qualification\\n- Provide a one-hour training session with examples and calibration task of 20 sample examples. Expect annotator qualification with >=85% agreement on calibration set.\\n- Provide an annotation manual with examples and quick decision rules (this document).\\n\\nAnnotation throughput and staffing estimate (for 200 validation examples)\\n- Average annotation times (estimates):\\n  - Arithmetic example: 1.5–3.0 minutes\\n  - Semantic parse: 3–6 minutes (denotation or normalization)\\n  - Code (with auto-tests): 4–8 minutes if auto-run works; 8–20 minutes if manual review is needed\\n  - CoT rating: 1–3 minutes\\n\\nStaffing plan (200 examples)\\n- Required annotators: 3 annotators total (to enable double annotation + adjudication):\\n  - Each example annotated twice (2 annotations) -> 400 annotation instances.\\n  - With 3 annotators, distribute ~133 annotation instances per annotator.\\n- Time per annotator estimate (average across tasks ~4 minutes per annotation):\\n  - 133 * 4 min = ~532 minutes ≈ 8.9 hours\\n  - Add 2 hours for training/calibration + 1 hour for review = ~12 hours/annotator\\n- Adjudication:\\n  - Expect ~15–25% disagreements (estimate) -> ~30–50 adjudication cases (3rd annotator time included above as distributed).\\n- Minimum staffing: 3 annotators trained and available; 1 project manager for QC (part-time).\\n\\nAnnotation tool recommendation\\n- Recommended: LabelStudio (open-source, free/community) — supports multi-annotator workflows, double-annotation, custom schemas, export to JSONL/CSV, role-based access.\\n- Alternative: Prodigy (paid) if you prefer active learning and faster interface.\\n- Rationale for LabelStudio:\\n  - Easy to install and host internally\\n  - Supports multiple users, assignments, overlaps for IAA\\n  - Export in JSON or CSV for ingestion\\n\\nLabelStudio configuration notes\\n- Create a project per task (arithmetic, code, semantic parsing).\\n- Define schema matching the required output fields (final_correct, final_answer_normalized, cot_rating, etc.)\\n- Use assignment overlaps (set overlap to 2) to get double annotation per example.\\n- Set up an adjudication workflow for disagreements.\\n\\nPART 4 — Privacy / compliance checklist (for human annotators)\\n\\nPrivacy and compliance checklist\\n- PII handling:\\n  - Prohibit annotators from exporting, downloading, or copying PII outside the annotation environment.\\n  - Redact or hash PII in stored examples where possible (names, emails, phone numbers, SSNs).\\n  - If an example necessitates PII exposure for correctness, log the minimal access and restrict to vetted annotators.\\n- Data minimization:\\n  - Only present necessary fields to annotators.\\n  - Use reduced context or obfuscated PII for training if possible.\\n- Consent and provenance:\\n  - Ensure dataset sources have appropriate licenses and consent for human review.\\n  - Maintain an audit trail: who accessed which sample and when.\\n- Data retention:\\n  - Define retention policy (e.g., annotations stored for X months); archive or delete raw PII within Y days post-annotation.\\n- Secure storage:\\n  - Store annotations and samples in encrypted storage (S3 with SSE or GCS with CMEK).\\n  - Enforce least privilege access; use role-based access management.\\n- Legal controls:\\n  - When using third-party annotators, require NDAs and Data Processing Agreements (DPA).\\n  - Verify third parties meet security standards (SOC2, ISO27001) if they will handle sensitive content.\\n- Audit and monitoring:\\n  - Log accesses, and run regular audits.\\n  - Randomly sample annotator work for QA.\\n\\nThird-party vs in-house annotators\\n- Recommendation: Prefer in-house annotators for any PII or sensitive content.\\n- Third-party: allowed only if:\\n  - They sign NDAs and DPA\\n  - They meet security certifications\\n  - Data is appropriately minimized/obfuscated\\n- Please confirm organizational policy; I cannot make the legal determination.\\n\\nPART 5 — Runbook (validate samples and submission instructions)\\n\\nrunbook (short) — to include in runbook.md or included below\\n\\n1) Validating samples locally with schema/validate_samples.py\\n- Prereqs:\\n  - Python 3.9+\\n  - Install requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt\\n  - (Optional) virtualenv\\n- Example command:\\npython schema/validate_samples.py --schema schema/schema.json --samples samples/validation.jsonl --out validation_report.json\\n\\n- Expected output:\\n  - validation_report.json containing per-sample pass/fail and a summary of missing fields, type errors, and normalization warnings.\\n- Common fixes:\\n  - Type mismatches: convert numeric strings to numbers or vice versa according to schema.\\n  - Missing fields: populate defaults or add fields into ingestion scripts.\\n\\n2) Running the evaluation scripts (example commands)\\n- Arithmetic:\\npython evaluation_scripts/compute_arithmetic_metrics.py --pred predictions.jsonl --gold samples/validation.jsonl --out results_arithmetic.json\\n\\n- Code:\\npython evaluation_scripts/run_code_tests.py --pred candidates.jsonl --gold samples/validation.jsonl --max-workers 8 --timeout 30 --out results_code.json\\n\\n- Semantic parsing:\\npython evaluation_scripts/compute_denotation_accuracy.py --pred predictions.jsonl --gold samples/validation.jsonl --db snapshots/validation.db --out results_semparse.json\\n\\n3) Submitting annotated examples back into repo / storage\\n- Format:\\n  - Output JSONL with one object per line, fields:\\n    - id (string)\\n    - annotation: {\\n        annotator_id: string,\\n        final_correct: bool|null,\\n        final_answer_normalized: string|null,\\n        cot_rating: int|null,\\n        cot_comments: string|null,\\n        privacy_flag: bool,\\n        validation_status: \"annotated\"|\"adjudicated\"|\"rejected\"\\n      }\\n  - Keep original example fields present to allow re-ingestion.\\n- Filename convention: annotations/<task>/annotator_<annotatorid>_<YYYYMMDD>.jsonl\\n- Submission paths:\\n  - Preferred: S3 path: s3://<BUCKET>/dataset/annotations/<task>/<filename>.jsonl\\n  - Alternative: GCS path: gs://<BUCKET>/dataset/annotations/<task>/<filename>.jsonl\\n  - Alternatively, push to repo branch: repo/annotations/<task>/<filename>.jsonl (if data size permits)\\n- Upload checklist:\\n  - Validate JSONL schema with schema/validate_samples.py (or a dedicated validator that checks annotation structure)\\n  - Ensure encryption and role permissions on the target bucket\\n  - Notify repo owner/CI with a PR or ticket linking the new annotation file\\n\\n4) CI / PR integration (recommended)\\n- Add a CI step that runs schema/validate_samples.py on new annotation files in PRs and fails if schema checks fail.\\n- Add automatic metrics computation when annotated validation set is updated.\\n\\nDeliverable files I will produce\\n- evaluation_rubric.md (content above)\\n- evaluation_metrics.json (content above)\\n- evaluation_metrics.csv (content above)\\n- annotator_guidelines.md (content above)\\n- runbook.md (content above plus commands specific to your scripts once I can inspect them)\\n\\nImmediate requests from coder (required to proceed)\\nPlease provide these items ASAP so I can complete the verification and run the validations within 3 business days:\\n1) Grant read (and if allowed, write) access to the repository OR upload the following files here:\\n   - schema/schema.json\\n   - samples/*.jsonl (validation/seed/test splits)\\n   - ingestion_scripts/ (or schema/validate_samples.py)\\n   - any evaluation scripts already present (evaluation_scripts/)\\n2) Compute & storage details:\\n   - Do you have GPU-based machines for model inference?

Human-readable evaluation_rubric.md (draft)\\n(Entire .md content below; you can copy-paste into evaluation_rubric.md)\\n\\n---\\n\\nevaluation_rubric.md (DRAFT)\\n\\nOverview\\n- This document maps each target task to one or more evaluation metrics, specifies conservative and ambitious thresholds, and gives exact computation guidance (scripts/pseudocode). Use these metrics on the validation set unless noted otherwise.\\n\\nAssumptions\\n- The \"spec\" includes standard metrics: Exact Match (EM), Numeric Tolerance, Denotation Accuracy, Execution Accuracy / Unit-Tests pass rate, pass@k, BLEU/ROUGE for free-form text.\\n- Predictions are provided as a JSONL file with one object per line with at minimum fields: id, prediction (string), and optionally samples (for pass@k).\\n\\n1) Arithmetic / Math\\n- Primary metric: Numeric Exact Match within tolerance (EM_num).\\n  - Conservative threshold: 90% validation EM_num\\n  - Ambitious threshold: 98% validation EM_num\\n- Secondary metric: Average Absolute Error (MAE) or relative error for regression-style tasks.\\n  - Conservative: MAE <= 0.02 * |mean_gold|\\n  - Ambitious: MAE <= 0.005 * |mean_gold|\\n\\nHow to compute:\\n- For each example:\\n  - If gold has numeric_tolerance: use that.\\n  - Else default: absolute tolerance = 1e-6 for integers, or relative=1e-6 for floats.\\n- EM_num = fraction of examples where |pred - gold| <= max(absolute_tolerance, relative_tolerance * |gold|)\\n- MAE = mean(|pred - gold|)\\n\\nPseudocode:\\n- See evaluation_scripts/compute_arithmetic_metrics.py\\n  - parse predictions and gold\\n  - coerce to numeric (handle strings like \"45\", \"45.0\", \"45 +/- 1\")\\n  - evaluate using tolerances\\n\\nCommand (example):\\npython evaluation_scripts/compute_arithmetic_metrics.py \\\\\\n  --pred predictions.jsonl \\\\\\n  --gold samples/validation.jsonl \\\\\\n  --out results_arithmetic.json\\n\\n2) Code generation\\n- Primary metric: Execution Accuracy (unit tests pass rate)\\n  - Conservative (pass rate on unit tests): 40% (pass@1)\\n  - Ambitious: 70% (pass@1)\\n- Secondary metric: pass@k (for sampling-based models), where k is typically 5 or 10.\\n  - Conservative pass@5 >= 55%\\n  - Ambitious pass@5 >= 85%\\n- Safety metric: sandbox escape rate = 0\\n\\nHow to compute:\\n- For each problem with N candidate predictions (N≥1):\\n  - If unit tests provided: attempt to run candidate code in sandbox; mark success if all tests pass.\\n  - Execution Accuracy = fraction of problems where at least one candidate passes tests (for pass@k, compute fraction with any pass among k samples).\\n- pass@k formula (for sampled outputs with n independent samples and c successes) — use standard closed-form estimate:\\n  - pass@k = 1 - comb(n-c,k)/comb(n,k)   (for exact formula when sampling w/o replacement)\\n  - If you have only one sample, pass@1 = fraction of single-sample that passes.\\n\\nPseudocode for running tests:\\n- For each example:\\n  - create ephemeral container with required language/runtime\\n  - install dependencies\\n  - run tests with timeout and resource limits (no network)\\n  - capture stdout/stderr and exit code\\n  - mark pass if tests exit with code 0 and expected outputs match\\n\\nCommand (example):\\n# sandbox runner (requires Docker + test harness)\\npython evaluation_scripts/run_code_tests.py \\\\\\n  --pred candidates.jsonl \\\\\\n  --gold samples/validation.jsonl \\\\\\n  --max-workers 8 \\\\\\n  --timeout 30 \\\\\\n  --out results_code.json\\n\\nNotes:\\n- If running code in CI is disallowed, fallback is to run static checks (compilation, simple outputs), or human evaluation.\\n\\n3) Semantic parsing (text -> MR/SQL)\\n- Primary metric: Denotation Accuracy (DA) — run MR against canonical database and compare results\\n  - Conservative threshold: 75% denotation accuracy\\n  - Ambitious threshold: 95% denotation accuracy\\n- Secondary metric: Exact Match (EM) on normalized MR (after canonicalization)\\n  - Conservative: 60%\\n  - Ambitious: 90%\\n\\nHow to compute:\\n- If executor_config / DB snapshot is available:\\n  - Run MR and normalize returned results; comparison is set-equality (order-insensitive) unless domain requires order.\\n- If no executable environment, use normalized string EM on canonical_form (tokenization & canonicalization steps must be specified)\\n\\nCommand (example):\\npython evaluation_scripts/compute_denotation_accuracy.py \\\\\\n  --pred predictions.jsonl \\\\\\n  --gold samples/validation.jsonl \\\\\\n  --db snapshots/mysql_validation.db \\\\\\n  --out results_semparse.json\\n\\n4) Explanation / Chain-of-Thought (CoT) quality rubric\\n- Metric: Human-rated CoT quality 1-5 scale (see rubric below). For aggregate metrics, report average score and % >= 4.\\n\\nCoT rubric (1–5)\\n- 5 (Excellent): Correct final answer; step-by-step reasoning is logically correct, complete, concise, and would allow an expert to verify each step. No hallucinations. Example: clear algebra steps with each transformation explicitly stated and correct.\\n- 4 (Good): Correct final answer; reasoning mostly correct with minor omissions or small inefficiencies, but no incorrect steps that affect final answer.\\n- 3 (Acceptable): Final answer correct but reasoning has several gaps or unclear steps that require filling in; or reasoning mostly correct but contains a minor incorrect inference that doesn\\'t affect final.\\n- 2 (Poor): Final answer possibly correct (or incorrect); reasoning contains major mistakes or unjustified leaps; steps are ambiguous or contradictory.\\n- 1 (Bad): Final answer incorrect and reasoning is wrong, incoherent, or hallucinated.\\n\\nCoT rubric examples (short)\\n- Example (5): \"To solve 2x+3=7: subtract 3 => 2x=4 => x=2.\"\\n- Example (3): \"Solve: 2x+3=7. So x=4/2=2.\" (skips subtraction explicit mention)\\n- Example (1): \"x=7+3/2=5.5\" (incorrect step)\\n\\nCoT scoring instructions for annotators:\\n- Check correctness of each reasoning step.\\n- Check whether any step uses unsupported facts.\\n- Check clarity & sufficiency.\\n\\n5) Aggregation reporting\\n- Provide overall metrics per-task and broken down by difficulty, source, or length buckets (e.g., prompt length).\\n- Provide confusion analysis and sample failures.\\n\\nMachine-readable mapping (JSON)\\n- Provided below as \"evaluation_metrics.json\".\\n\\n---\\n\\nB.

They will also correct or provide canonical answers when asked.\\n\\nGeneral instructions\\n1. Read the prompt and gold/reference carefully.\\n2. For each model response, answer the required fields in the annotation UI:\\n   - final_answer_correct? (Yes/No)\\n   - final_answer_normalized (text)\\n   - reason_steps_quality (1–5)\\n   - notes (free text)\\n   - any safety/PII concerns? (Yes/No + comment)\\n3. Use gold references and test harnesses where available. If a task includes a run/test harness, use it rather than manual inspection to assess correctness.\\n\\nSpecific instructions per task\\n\\nArithmetic tasks\\n- Normalize numerical answers: strip commas, normal scientific notation accepted.\\n- Use numeric tolerances provided in example; if none provided:\\n  - default absolute tolerance = 1e-6 for floats;\\n  - for integer expected_format, enforce exact integer match.\\n- If multiple answers are acceptable, select “Yes” if prediction matches any acceptable answer after normalization.\\n- Edge cases:\\n  - Answers like \"45 (approx.)\" should be considered correct if within tolerance.\\n  - If units are required (e.g., meters), check units; missing unit is incorrect if unit was explicitly required.\\n\\nCode tasks\\n- Attempt to run candidate code in the provided sandbox runner (tests provided).\\n- Mark final_answer_correct only if code passes all unit tests or matches expected outputs for provided inputs.\\n- If unit tests cannot run (external dependencies/network/etc.), annotate as \"Cannot Auto-Evaluate\" and provide manual review notes:\\n  - Does the code compile?\\n  - Are obvious security issues present (e.g., os.system with network/exec)?\\n- For subtle correctness issues (time complexity, edge cases), annotate notes and mark rating accordingly.\\n\\nSemantic parsing\\n- If an executor and DB snapshot exist, prefer denotation check: run MR and compare result set to gold denotation.\\n- If only canonical MR is available, perform canonicalization (strip whitespace, normalized aliases) then exact-match on tokens.\\n- For ambiguous queries, record whether multiple MRs would be acceptable and annotate accordingly.\\n\\nCoT (Chain-of-Thought) rating (1–5)\\n- See rubric in evaluation_rubric.md. Rate reasoning on logical validity, completeness, clarity, and lack of hallucination.\\n- Examples:\\n  - 5: Step-by-step derivation with correct transformations.\\n  - 3: Correct answer but skipped intermediate steps or not sufficient to reproduce work.\\n  - 1: Incorrect logic leading to wrong answer or hallucinated facts.\\n\\nAnnotation UI fields (recommended fields)\\n- example_id (immutable)\\n- annotator_id\\n- timestamp\\n- final_correct (yes/no/cannot_evaluate)\\n- final_answer_normalized (text)\\n- cot_rating (1..5)\\n- cot_comments (text)\\n- eval_notes (text)\\n- privacy_flag (true/false)\\n- reviewer_needed (true/false if disagreement)\\n\\nCorner cases and decision rules\\n- Multiple correct outputs: mark as correct if any predicted output equals any gold reference after normalization; document ambiguous cases.\\n- Non-deterministic problems: If code can produce different but valid outputs, consult gold denotation or mark as manual-review.\\n- Incomplete CoT: if CoT contains correct steps but omits step notation between two heavy leaps, rate 3.\\n- Safety/PII: If prompt or output contains PII, tag privacy_flag and do not copy PII into external tools.\\n\\nInter-annotator agreement and adjudication\\n- Required target: Cohen\\'s kappa >= 0.8 for categorical final_correct, Krippendorff\\'s alpha >= 0.8 for CoT rating aggregation (or equivalent).\\n- Annotation plan:\\n  - Each example will be double-annotated (2 annotators).\\n  - Disagreements on final_correct or cot_rating escalated to a 3rd annotator (adjudicator).\\n  - Adjudicator final decision recorded.\\n\\nAnnotator training and qualification\\n- Provide a one-hour training session with examples and calibration task of 20 sample examples. Expect annotator qualification with >=85% agreement on calibration set.\\n- Provide an annotation manual with examples and quick decision rules (this document).\\n\\nAnnotation throughput and staffing estimate (for 200 validation examples)\\n- Average annotation times (estimates):\\n  - Arithmetic example: 1.5–3.0 minutes\\n  - Semantic parse: 3–6 minutes (denotation or normalization)\\n  - Code (with auto-tests): 4–8 minutes if auto-run works; 8–20 minutes if manual review is needed\\n  - CoT rating: 1–3 minutes\\n\\nStaffing plan (200 examples)\\n- Required annotators: 3 annotators total (to enable double annotation + adjudication):\\n  - Each example annotated twice (2 annotations) -> 400 annotation instances.\\n  - With 3 annotators, distribute ~133 annotation instances per annotator.\\n- Time per annotator estimate (average across tasks ~4 minutes per annotation):\\n  - 133 * 4 min = ~532 minutes ≈ 8.9 hours\\n  - Add 2 hours for training/calibration + 1 hour for review = ~12 hours/annotator\\n- Adjudication:\\n  - Expect ~15–25% disagreements (estimate) -> ~30–50 adjudication cases (3rd annotator time included above as distributed).\\n- Minimum staffing: 3 annotators trained and available; 1 project manager for QC (part-time).\\n\\nAnnotation tool recommendation\\n- Recommended: LabelStudio (open-source, free/community) — supports multi-annotator workflows, double-annotation, custom schemas, export to JSONL/CSV, role-based access.\\n- Alternative: Prodigy (paid) if you prefer active learning and faster interface.\\n- Rationale for LabelStudio:\\n  - Easy to install and host internally\\n  - Supports multiple users, assignments, overlaps for IAA\\n  - Export in JSON or CSV for ingestion\\n\\nLabelStudio configuration notes\\n- Create a project per task (arithmetic, code, semantic parsing).\\n- Define schema matching the required output fields (final_correct, final_answer_normalized, cot_rating, etc.)\\n- Use assignment overlaps (set overlap to 2) to get double annotation per example.\\n- Set up an adjudication workflow for disagreements.\\n\\nPART 4 — Privacy / compliance checklist (for human annotators)\\n\\nPrivacy and compliance checklist\\n- PII handling:\\n  - Prohibit annotators from exporting, downloading, or copying PII outside the annotation environment.\\n  - Redact or hash PII in stored examples where possible (names, emails, phone numbers, SSNs).\\n  - If an example necessitates PII exposure for correctness, log the minimal access and restrict to vetted annotators.\\n- Data minimization:\\n  - Only present necessary fields to annotators.\\n  - Use reduced context or obfuscated PII for training if possible.\\n- Consent and provenance:\\n  - Ensure dataset sources have appropriate licenses and consent for human review.\\n  - Maintain an audit trail: who accessed which sample and when.\\n- Data retention:\\n  - Define retention policy (e.g., annotations stored for X months); archive or delete raw PII within Y days post-annotation.\\n- Secure storage:\\n  - Store annotations and samples in encrypted storage (S3 with SSE or GCS with CMEK).\\n  - Enforce least privilege access; use role-based access management.\\n- Legal controls:\\n  - When using third-party annotators, require NDAs and Data Processing Agreements (DPA).\\n  - Verify third parties meet security standards (SOC2, ISO27001) if they will handle sensitive content.\\n- Audit and monitoring:\\n  - Log accesses, and run regular audits.\\n  - Randomly sample annotator work for QA.\\n\\nThird-party vs in-house annotators\\n- Recommendation: Prefer in-house annotators for any PII or sensitive content.\\n- Third-party: allowed only if:\\n  - They sign NDAs and DPA\\n  - They meet security certifications\\n  - Data is appropriately minimized/obfuscated\\n- Please confirm organizational policy; I cannot make the legal determination.\\n\\nPART 5 — Runbook (validate samples and submission instructions)\\n\\nrunbook (short) — to include in runbook.md or included below\\n\\n1) Validating samples locally with schema/validate_samples.py\\n- Prereqs:\\n  - Python 3.9+\\n  - Install requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt\\n  - (Optional) virtualenv\\n- Example command:\\npython schema/validate_samples.py --schema schema/schema.json --samples samples/validation.jsonl --out validation_report.json\\n\\n- Expected output:\\n  - validation_report.json containing per-sample pass/fail and a summary of missing fields, type errors, and normalization warnings.\\n- Common fixes:\\n  - Type mismatches: convert numeric strings to numbers or vice versa according to schema.\\n  - Missing fields: populate defaults or add fields into ingestion scripts.\\n\\n2) Running the evaluation scripts (example commands)\\n- Arithmetic:\\npython evaluation_scripts/compute_arithmetic_metrics.py --pred predictions.jsonl --gold samples/validation.jsonl --out results_arithmetic.json\\n\\n- Code:\\npython evaluation_scripts/run_code_tests.py --pred candidates.jsonl --gold samples/validation.jsonl --max-workers 8 --timeout 30 --out results_code.json\\n\\n- Semantic parsing:\\npython evaluation_scripts/compute_denotation_accuracy.py --pred predictions.jsonl --gold samples/validation.jsonl --db snapshots/validation.db --out results_semparse.json\\n\\n3) Submitting annotated examples back into repo / storage\\n- Format:\\n  - Output JSONL with one object per line, fields:\\n    - id (string)\\n    - annotation: {\\n        annotator_id: string,\\n        final_correct: bool|null,\\n        final_answer_normalized: string|null,\\n        cot_rating: int|null,\\n        cot_comments: string|null,\\n        privacy_flag: bool,\\n        validation_status: \"annotated\"|\"adjudicated\"|\"rejected\"\\n      }\\n  - Keep original example fields present to allow re-ingestion.\\n- Filename convention: annotations/<task>/annotator_<annotatorid>_<YYYYMMDD>.jsonl\\n- Submission paths:\\n  - Preferred: S3 path: s3://<BUCKET>/dataset/annotations/<task>/<filename>.jsonl\\n  - Alternative: GCS path: gs://<BUCKET>/dataset/annotations/<task>/<filename>.jsonl\\n  - Alternatively, push to repo branch: repo/annotations/<task>/<filename>.jsonl (if data size permits)\\n- Upload checklist:\\n  - Validate JSONL schema with schema/validate_samples.py (or a dedicated validator that checks annotation structure)\\n  - Ensure encryption and role permissions on the target bucket\\n  - Notify repo owner/CI with a PR or ticket linking the new annotation file\\n\\n4) CI / PR integration (recommended)\\n- Add a CI step that runs schema/validate_samples.py on new annotation files in PRs and fails if schema checks fail.\\n- Add automatic metrics computation when annotated validation set is updated.\\n\\nDeliverable files I will produce\\n- evaluation_rubric.md (content above)\\n- evaluation_metrics.json (content above)\\n- evaluation_metrics.csv (content above)\\n- annotator_guidelines.md (content above)\\n- runbook.md (content above plus commands specific to your scripts once I can inspect them)\\n\\nImmediate requests from coder (required to proceed)\\nPlease provide these items ASAP so I can complete the verification and run the validations within 3 business days:\\n1) Grant read (and if allowed, write) access to the repository OR upload the following files here:\\n   - schema/schema.json\\n   - samples/*.jsonl (validation/seed/test splits)\\n   - ingestion_scripts/ (or schema/validate_samples.py)\\n   - any evaluation scripts already present (evaluation_scripts/)\\n2) Compute & storage details:\\n   - Do you have GPU-based machines for model inference?

FACTS TO LOOK UP\\n- State‑of‑the‑art research on reasoning and problem parsing: search arXiv, Google Scholar, ACL Anthology, ICLR/NeurIPS/ICML/AAAI conference proceedings.\\n- Relevant benchmarks and datasets (descriptions, sizes, splits, licensing): GSM8K, MATH, BigBench, MMLU, StrategyQA, ARC, DROP, HotpotQA, SQuAD, HumanEval, (find on Papers With Code, Hugging Face datasets, dataset authors’ GitHub repos).\\n- Recent model architectures and performance numbers for reasoning tasks: Papers and leaderboards on Papers With Code, model cards on Hugging Face Model Hub, arXiv papers (e.g., on chain‑of‑thought, reasoning fine‑tuning, retrieval‑augmented generation).\\n- Semantic/syntactic parsing tools and standards: Universal Dependencies treebanks, AMR resources, Stanford CoreNLP, spaCy, AllenNLP (official docs and GitHub).\\n- Code/logic execution tools and program‑synthesis approaches for reasoning: GitHub projects, relevant papers (program synthesis, neural symbolic methods), and language model tool integrations.\\n- Evaluation metrics and human‑evaluation protocols for reasoning chains: academic papers, evaluation sections in benchmark papers, and methodology documents (e.g., exact match, accuracy, BLEU/ROUGE for some outputs, human rubric templates).\\n- Annotation guidelines and best practices for creating labeled reasoning chains: dataset papers, data‑collection appendices, and crowdsourcing platform docs (Mechanical Turk guidelines).\\n- Compute, memory, and cost estimates for training/inference given model sizes: cloud provider pricing pages (AWS/GCP/Azure), and reported costs in large‑model papers.\\n- Legal, privacy, and safety considerations (e.g., data licensing, GDPR, model deployment risk): official legal texts and organizational policy pages (GDPR site, model licensing docs).\\n- Implementation tooling and libraries for ML pipelines and deployment: TensorFlow/PyTorch docs, Hugging Face Transformers/Accelerate, LangChain-like orchestration frameworks (project docs/GitHub).\\n\\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\\n- Requirements and tradeoffs for architecture choices (model size, retrieval vs pure LLM, modular symbolic components) from goals and resource constraints.\\n- Expected dataset sizes and labeling effort needed to reach target accuracy for specific tasks (estimate from benchmark sample sizes and learning curves).\\n- Computational resource needs (GPU hours, memory) for training, fine‑tuning, and inference for chosen model classes — derived from model parameters and similar published setups.\\n- Latency and throughput targets for deployment and whether they meet user requirements; derive expected latencies from model sizes and hardware.\\n- Appropriate evaluation metrics and thresholds that map to success criteria for your application (e.g., X% exact match for math problems, human satisfaction score).\\n- Potential failure modes and their likelihoods (hallucination, brittleness to prompt phrasing, parsing ambiguities), and derived mitigation strategies (calibration, verification layers).\\n- Annotation schema and inter‑annotator agreement targets needed to ensure label quality.\\n- Cost estimates (in USD) for development, fine‑tuning, and production inference given chosen cloud/hardware options.\\n- Number and type of ablations/experiments required to isolate useful components (e.g., retrieval on/off, chain‑of‑thought vs no CoT).\\n\\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\\n- Effective architecture will likely be transformer‑based LLMs augmented with retrieval and a symbolic/structured parsing module for robust problem parsing.\\n- Chain‑of‑thought prompting or supervised reasoning chain fine‑tuning plus self‑consistency sampling will probably improve complex reasoning performance.\\n- High‑quality training/evaluation data for reasoning chains will require thousands to tens of thousands of curated examples for good generalization, plus targeted synthetic augmentation.\\n- For many reasoning tasks, a medium‑to‑large LLM (hundreds of millions to tens of billions of parameters) will perform substantially better than small models; tradeoffs in cost and latency will drive the final choice.\\n- Programmatic verification (executing generated programs or checks) will significantly reduce hallucinations and increase reliability for numerical/logical problems.\\n- Benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH are likely to be informative early indicators of progress; real‑world task performance will require additional domain‑specific datasets and human evaluation.\\n- Initial deployment should include human‑in‑the‑loop verification for edge cases and a monitoring pipeline to catch regressions and misparses.\\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\n- Define scope and success criteria (what “reasoning” and “problem parsing” mean for your product; target tasks, latency, accuracy). — lead: generator; support: verifier.\\n\\n- Rapid literature and benchmark scan to pick relevant datasets and baselines (GSM8K, MATH, StrategyQA, parsing corpora). — lead: coder; deliver list to generator.\\n\\n- Select prototype architecture and tooling (LLM size, retrieval vs. pure LM, symbolic parsing module, evaluation stack). — lead: generator; implementable spec by coder.\\n\\n- Collect/curate initial dataset and annotation guidelines (seed with public benchmarks + domain examples; define reasoning-chain format and inter-annotator rules). — lead: generator; coder to ingest datasets; verifier to review guidelines.\\n\\n- Build a minimal end-to-end prototype pipeline: tokenizer/model integration, retrieval index (if used), parser component (AMR/UD or custom), and output formatting. — lead: coder.\\n\\n- Develop evaluation plan and metrics (exact match / accuracy / reasoning-chain quality rubrics, human-eval protocol, unit tests for parsers). — lead: verifier; generator to draft rubrics.\\n\\n- Run baseline experiments and small-scale fine-tuning; collect quantitative results and failure cases. — lead: coder; verifier to validate results.\\n\\n- Perform targeted ablations (e.g., with/without chain-of-thought, retrieval on/off, parser module on/off) to identify what drives gains. — lead: coder; verifier to analyze.\\n\\n- Iterate on data and model improvements (augment training data, refine prompts or supervised chain-of-thought, add verification checks or programmatic validators). — lead: coder; verifier to confirm improvements.\\n\\n- Produce user-facing behavior and output templates, plus final evaluation report (performance, error modes, recommended next steps). — lead: generator; verifier to sign off.\\n\\n- Plan deployment & monitoring: latency/throughput estimates, cost estimate, safety/privacy checklist, continuous evaluation hooks, and human-in-the-loop escalation paths. — lead: generator; verifier to audit; coder to prototype monitoring.\\n\\n- Schedule regular checkpoints (design → prototype → eval → iterate) and define deliverables for each checkpoint. — lead: generator; all team members accountable per checkpoint.\\n\"}], 'author_name': 'magentic_manager', 'additional_properties': {}}\n",

Human-readable evaluation_rubric.md (draft)\\n(Entire .md content below; you can copy-paste into evaluation_rubric.md)\\n\\n---\\n\\nevaluation_rubric.md (DRAFT)\\n\\nOverview\\n- This document maps each target task to one or more evaluation metrics, specifies conservative and ambitious thresholds, and gives exact computation guidance (scripts/pseudocode). Use these metrics on the validation set unless noted otherwise.\\n\\nAssumptions\\n- The \"spec\" includes standard metrics: Exact Match (EM), Numeric Tolerance, Denotation Accuracy, Execution Accuracy / Unit-Tests pass rate, pass@k, BLEU/ROUGE for free-form text.\\n- Predictions are provided as a JSONL file with one object per line with at minimum fields: id, prediction (string), and optionally samples (for pass@k).\\n\\n1) Arithmetic / Math\\n- Primary metric: Numeric Exact Match within tolerance (EM_num).\\n  - Conservative threshold: 90% validation EM_num\\n  - Ambitious threshold: 98% validation EM_num\\n- Secondary metric: Average Absolute Error (MAE) or relative error for regression-style tasks.\\n  - Conservative: MAE <= 0.02 * |mean_gold|\\n  - Ambitious: MAE <= 0.005 * |mean_gold|\\n\\nHow to compute:\\n- For each example:\\n  - If gold has numeric_tolerance: use that.\\n  - Else default: absolute tolerance = 1e-6 for integers, or relative=1e-6 for floats.\\n- EM_num = fraction of examples where |pred - gold| <= max(absolute_tolerance, relative_tolerance * |gold|)\\n- MAE = mean(|pred - gold|)\\n\\nPseudocode:\\n- See evaluation_scripts/compute_arithmetic_metrics.py\\n  - parse predictions and gold\\n  - coerce to numeric (handle strings like \"45\", \"45.0\", \"45 +/- 1\")\\n  - evaluate using tolerances\\n\\nCommand (example):\\npython evaluation_scripts/compute_arithmetic_metrics.py \\\\\\n  --pred predictions.jsonl \\\\\\n  --gold samples/validation.jsonl \\\\\\n  --out results_arithmetic.json\\n\\n2) Code generation\\n- Primary metric: Execution Accuracy (unit tests pass rate)\\n  - Conservative (pass rate on unit tests): 40% (pass@1)\\n  - Ambitious: 70% (pass@1)\\n- Secondary metric: pass@k (for sampling-based models), where k is typically 5 or 10.\\n  - Conservative pass@5 >= 55%\\n  - Ambitious pass@5 >= 85%\\n- Safety metric: sandbox escape rate = 0\\n\\nHow to compute:\\n- For each problem with N candidate predictions (N≥1):\\n  - If unit tests provided: attempt to run candidate code in sandbox; mark success if all tests pass.\\n  - Execution Accuracy = fraction of problems where at least one candidate passes tests (for pass@k, compute fraction with any pass among k samples).\\n- pass@k formula (for sampled outputs with n independent samples and c successes) — use standard closed-form estimate:\\n  - pass@k = 1 - comb(n-c,k)/comb(n,k)   (for exact formula when sampling w/o replacement)\\n  - If you have only one sample, pass@1 = fraction of single-sample that passes.\\n\\nPseudocode for running tests:\\n- For each example:\\n  - create ephemeral container with required language/runtime\\n  - install dependencies\\n  - run tests with timeout and resource limits (no network)\\n  - capture stdout/stderr and exit code\\n  - mark pass if tests exit with code 0 and expected outputs match\\n\\nCommand (example):\\n# sandbox runner (requires Docker + test harness)\\npython evaluation_scripts/run_code_tests.py \\\\\\n  --pred candidates.jsonl \\\\\\n  --gold samples/validation.jsonl \\\\\\n  --max-workers 8 \\\\\\n  --timeout 30 \\\\\\n  --out results_code.json\\n\\nNotes:\\n- If running code in CI is disallowed, fallback is to run static checks (compilation, simple outputs), or human evaluation.\\n\\n3) Semantic parsing (text -> MR/SQL)\\n- Primary metric: Denotation Accuracy (DA) — run MR against canonical database and compare results\\n  - Conservative threshold: 75% denotation accuracy\\n  - Ambitious threshold: 95% denotation accuracy\\n- Secondary metric: Exact Match (EM) on normalized MR (after canonicalization)\\n  - Conservative: 60%\\n  - Ambitious: 90%\\n\\nHow to compute:\\n- If executor_config / DB snapshot is available:\\n  - Run MR and normalize returned results; comparison is set-equality (order-insensitive) unless domain requires order.\\n- If no executable environment, use normalized string EM on canonical_form (tokenization & canonicalization steps must be specified)\\n\\nCommand (example):\\npython evaluation_scripts/compute_denotation_accuracy.py \\\\\\n  --pred predictions.jsonl \\\\\\n  --gold samples/validation.jsonl \\\\\\n  --db snapshots/mysql_validation.db \\\\\\n  --out results_semparse.json\\n\\n4) Explanation / Chain-of-Thought (CoT) quality rubric\\n- Metric: Human-rated CoT quality 1-5 scale (see rubric below). For aggregate metrics, report average score and % >= 4.\\n\\nCoT rubric (1–5)\\n- 5 (Excellent): Correct final answer; step-by-step reasoning is logically correct, complete, concise, and would allow an expert to verify each step. No hallucinations. Example: clear algebra steps with each transformation explicitly stated and correct.\\n- 4 (Good): Correct final answer; reasoning mostly correct with minor omissions or small inefficiencies, but no incorrect steps that affect final answer.\\n- 3 (Acceptable): Final answer correct but reasoning has several gaps or unclear steps that require filling in; or reasoning mostly correct but contains a minor incorrect inference that doesn\\'t affect final.\\n- 2 (Poor): Final answer possibly correct (or incorrect); reasoning contains major mistakes or unjustified leaps; steps are ambiguous or contradictory.\\n- 1 (Bad): Final answer incorrect and reasoning is wrong, incoherent, or hallucinated.\\n\\nCoT rubric examples (short)\\n- Example (5): \"To solve 2x+3=7: subtract 3 => 2x=4 => x=2.\"\\n- Example (3): \"Solve: 2x+3=7. So x=4/2=2.\" (skips subtraction explicit mention)\\n- Example (1): \"x=7+3/2=5.5\" (incorrect step)\\n\\nCoT scoring instructions for annotators:\\n- Check correctness of each reasoning step.\\n- Check whether any step uses unsupported facts.\\n- Check clarity & sufficiency.\\n\\n5) Aggregation reporting\\n- Provide overall metrics per-task and broken down by difficulty, source, or length buckets (e.g., prompt length).\\n- Provide confusion analysis and sample failures.\\n\\nMachine-readable mapping (JSON)\\n- Provided below as \"evaluation_metrics.json\".\\n\\n---\\n\\nB.

They will also correct or provide canonical answers when asked.\\n\\nGeneral instructions\\n1. Read the prompt and gold/reference carefully.\\n2. For each model response, answer the required fields in the annotation UI:\\n   - final_answer_correct? (Yes/No)\\n   - final_answer_normalized (text)\\n   - reason_steps_quality (1–5)\\n   - notes (free text)\\n   - any safety/PII concerns? (Yes/No + comment)\\n3. Use gold references and test harnesses where available. If a task includes a run/test harness, use it rather than manual inspection to assess correctness.\\n\\nSpecific instructions per task\\n\\nArithmetic tasks\\n- Normalize numerical answers: strip commas, normal scientific notation accepted.\\n- Use numeric tolerances provided in example; if none provided:\\n  - default absolute tolerance = 1e-6 for floats;\\n  - for integer expected_format, enforce exact integer match.\\n- If multiple answers are acceptable, select “Yes” if prediction matches any acceptable answer after normalization.\\n- Edge cases:\\n  - Answers like \"45 (approx.)\" should be considered correct if within tolerance.\\n  - If units are required (e.g., meters), check units; missing unit is incorrect if unit was explicitly required.\\n\\nCode tasks\\n- Attempt to run candidate code in the provided sandbox runner (tests provided).\\n- Mark final_answer_correct only if code passes all unit tests or matches expected outputs for provided inputs.\\n- If unit tests cannot run (external dependencies/network/etc.), annotate as \"Cannot Auto-Evaluate\" and provide manual review notes:\\n  - Does the code compile?\\n  - Are obvious security issues present (e.g., os.system with network/exec)?\\n- For subtle correctness issues (time complexity, edge cases), annotate notes and mark rating accordingly.\\n\\nSemantic parsing\\n- If an executor and DB snapshot exist, prefer denotation check: run MR and compare result set to gold denotation.\\n- If only canonical MR is available, perform canonicalization (strip whitespace, normalized aliases) then exact-match on tokens.\\n- For ambiguous queries, record whether multiple MRs would be acceptable and annotate accordingly.\\n\\nCoT (Chain-of-Thought) rating (1–5)\\n- See rubric in evaluation_rubric.md. Rate reasoning on logical validity, completeness, clarity, and lack of hallucination.\\n- Examples:\\n  - 5: Step-by-step derivation with correct transformations.\\n  - 3: Correct answer but skipped intermediate steps or not sufficient to reproduce work.\\n  - 1: Incorrect logic leading to wrong answer or hallucinated facts.\\n\\nAnnotation UI fields (recommended fields)\\n- example_id (immutable)\\n- annotator_id\\n- timestamp\\n- final_correct (yes/no/cannot_evaluate)\\n- final_answer_normalized (text)\\n- cot_rating (1..5)\\n- cot_comments (text)\\n- eval_notes (text)\\n- privacy_flag (true/false)\\n- reviewer_needed (true/false if disagreement)\\n\\nCorner cases and decision rules\\n- Multiple correct outputs: mark as correct if any predicted output equals any gold reference after normalization; document ambiguous cases.\\n- Non-deterministic problems: If code can produce different but valid outputs, consult gold denotation or mark as manual-review.\\n- Incomplete CoT: if CoT contains correct steps but omits step notation between two heavy leaps, rate 3.\\n- Safety/PII: If prompt or output contains PII, tag privacy_flag and do not copy PII into external tools.\\n\\nInter-annotator agreement and adjudication\\n- Required target: Cohen\\'s kappa >= 0.8 for categorical final_correct, Krippendorff\\'s alpha >= 0.8 for CoT rating aggregation (or equivalent).\\n- Annotation plan:\\n  - Each example will be double-annotated (2 annotators).\\n  - Disagreements on final_correct or cot_rating escalated to a 3rd annotator (adjudicator).\\n  - Adjudicator final decision recorded.\\n\\nAnnotator training and qualification\\n- Provide a one-hour training session with examples and calibration task of 20 sample examples. Expect annotator qualification with >=85% agreement on calibration set.\\n- Provide an annotation manual with examples and quick decision rules (this document).\\n\\nAnnotation throughput and staffing estimate (for 200 validation examples)\\n- Average annotation times (estimates):\\n  - Arithmetic example: 1.5–3.0 minutes\\n  - Semantic parse: 3–6 minutes (denotation or normalization)\\n  - Code (with auto-tests): 4–8 minutes if auto-run works; 8–20 minutes if manual review is needed\\n  - CoT rating: 1–3 minutes\\n\\nStaffing plan (200 examples)\\n- Required annotators: 3 annotators total (to enable double annotation + adjudication):\\n  - Each example annotated twice (2 annotations) -> 400 annotation instances.\\n  - With 3 annotators, distribute ~133 annotation instances per annotator.\\n- Time per annotator estimate (average across tasks ~4 minutes per annotation):\\n  - 133 * 4 min = ~532 minutes ≈ 8.9 hours\\n  - Add 2 hours for training/calibration + 1 hour for review = ~12 hours/annotator\\n- Adjudication:\\n  - Expect ~15–25% disagreements (estimate) -> ~30–50 adjudication cases (3rd annotator time included above as distributed).\\n- Minimum staffing: 3 annotators trained and available; 1 project manager for QC (part-time).\\n\\nAnnotation tool recommendation\\n- Recommended: LabelStudio (open-source, free/community) — supports multi-annotator workflows, double-annotation, custom schemas, export to JSONL/CSV, role-based access.\\n- Alternative: Prodigy (paid) if you prefer active learning and faster interface.\\n- Rationale for LabelStudio:\\n  - Easy to install and host internally\\n  - Supports multiple users, assignments, overlaps for IAA\\n  - Export in JSON or CSV for ingestion\\n\\nLabelStudio configuration notes\\n- Create a project per task (arithmetic, code, semantic parsing).\\n- Define schema matching the required output fields (final_correct, final_answer_normalized, cot_rating, etc.)\\n- Use assignment overlaps (set overlap to 2) to get double annotation per example.\\n- Set up an adjudication workflow for disagreements.\\n\\nPART 4 — Privacy / compliance checklist (for human annotators)\\n\\nPrivacy and compliance checklist\\n- PII handling:\\n  - Prohibit annotators from exporting, downloading, or copying PII outside the annotation environment.\\n  - Redact or hash PII in stored examples where possible (names, emails, phone numbers, SSNs).\\n  - If an example necessitates PII exposure for correctness, log the minimal access and restrict to vetted annotators.\\n- Data minimization:\\n  - Only present necessary fields to annotators.\\n  - Use reduced context or obfuscated PII for training if possible.\\n- Consent and provenance:\\n  - Ensure dataset sources have appropriate licenses and consent for human review.\\n  - Maintain an audit trail: who accessed which sample and when.\\n- Data retention:\\n  - Define retention policy (e.g., annotations stored for X months);

I didn't include them in the repo zip to avoid mixing with code; I can produce them now in the next message. Quick plan: I will cover GSM8K, SVAMP, MATH, HumanEval, MBPP, HotpotQA, CommonsenseQA, Spider, UD (Universal Dependencies), AMR — each with canonical download link and licensing/usage note.

To proceed I need:\\n  - Access to a machine with internet and model caching, or to a provided model artifact (e.g., local Hugging Face model directory or llama binary).\\n- Reproducible example command (to run on your machine or CI):\\n  - Install deps:\\n    pip install transformers accelerate torch datasets jsonschema\\n  - Example inference (pseudo-command):\\n    python3 - <<'PY'\\\\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\\\\nm='google/flan-t5-small'\\\\n# load model and generate on a batch of prompts\\\\nPY\\n- Estimated resource requirements:\\n  - flan-t5-small: fits on CPU but benefits from a GPU with 4–8GB VRAM. For 50 examples runtime ~ seconds–minutes depending on batch size.\\n  - codegen-350M or codeparrot-small: 4–8GB VRAM recommended.\\n\\nQuestions / Needed permissions (please provide to proceed)\\n- Repo push access (Git URL + deploy key or PR permissions), or alternatively I can prepare a patch for you to apply.\\n- S3/GCS path + credentials (or a presigned URL) to write ingestion outputs and baselines.\\n- Compute spec: GPU types, counts, vCPU/RAM, storage quotas, preemptible/spot allowance, and monthly budget.\\n- Confirmation whether you want the literature/benchmark scan added to the repo as markdown files, or posted here in the chat.\\n\\nIf you want, I will:\\n- Immediately create and attach the literature & benchmark 1-paragraph summaries for the listed datasets here.\\n- Add more dataset-specific ingestion templates for HumanEval, MBPP, MATH, HotpotQA, CommonsenseQA, Spider, UD, and AMR to ingestion_scripts/ (they will use Hugging Face datasets or direct download URLs and will be ready to run in your environment).\\n- Create Dockerfile(s) and a GitHub Actions workflow that runs the ingestion and validation steps on push; I will need the target repo to push or CI secrets to execute on your runner.\\n\\nWhich next step would you like me to take now?\\n- (A) Produce the literature/benchmark scan here (1-paragraph each) — I can do that right away.\\n- (B) Add dataset-specific ingestion scripts into the repo and regenerate the zip (I can do that next, but need to know whether to prioritize particular datasets).\\n- (C) Wait for compute/storage/credentials from you before proceeding to run ingestion and baselines.\\n\\nIf you pick (A) or (B), I will proceed immediately and push updated artifacts into a new zip for download.\"}], 'author_name': 'CoderAgent', 'additional_properties': {}}\n",

If you supply credentials or a presigned upload URL, I will run the tasks and upload results within the 3-business-day window.\\n\\n1) Repo read/write OR upload repo zip (what I need / how you can provide)\\nWhat I can’t do now:\\n- I cannot push directly to your GitHub/GitLab without being granted push access or a deploy key / CI runner that I can use from here.\\nWhat I need (pick one):\\nA. Git repo access:\\n   - Add a service account or bot user as a collaborator with push rights (or create a repo and invite me). If you prefer using a deploy key, provide a deploy key or a CI token attached to a machine/runner I can use.\\n   - If you want me to open a PR instead of direct push, invite my GitHub handle to the repo or tell me which branch/PR process to follow (I will prepare a patch).\\nB. Upload the repo zip to your storage and give me a direct download or presigned URL:\\n   - S3: Provide a presigned GET URL or place the zip at s3://<bucket>/<prefix>/dataset_ingestion_repo.zip and give me access (or provide a presigned PUT for me to upload result files).\\n   - GCS: Provide a signed URL or put file at gs://<bucket>/<prefix>/dataset_ingestion_repo.zip and grant me read/write via a service account key.\\nExact recommended filename/location:\\n   - s3://<bucket>/ingestion/dataset_ingestion_repo.zip\\n   - or a single HTTP(S) URL I can download from.\\n\\n2) Storage path and credentials (where ingestion outputs & annotations will be written)\\nWhat I need (pick one preferred method):\\n- S3 credentials (temporary preferred):\\n  - AccessKeyId, SecretAccessKey, optional SessionToken + bucket name and prefix (e.g., ingestion-outputs/, or exact path).\\n  - Minimum required IAM actions scoped to the prefix:\\n    - s3:PutObject (arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET/ingestion/*)\\n    - s3:GetObject (to re-run or validate)\\n    - s3:ListBucket (optional, scoped to prefix)\\n  - Example IAM policy (JSON snippet) I will need:\\n    {\\n      \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\\n      \"Statement\": [\\n        {\\n          \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\\n          \"Action\": [\"s3:PutObject\", \"s3:GetObject\"],\\n          \"Resource\": [\"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/ingestion/*\"]\\n        },\\n        {\\n          \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\\n          \"Action\": [\"s3:ListBucket\"],\\n          \"Resource\": [\"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket\"],\\n          \"Condition\": { \"StringLike\": { \"s3:prefix\": [\"ingestion/*\"] } }\\n        }\\n      ]\\n    }\\n- GCS credentials:\\n  - A service account JSON key with roles/storage.objectCreator and roles/storage.objectViewer on the target bucket.\\n- If you prefer not to give credentials, provide a presigned PUT URL(s) for specific outputs I should upload (validation_report.json, predictions.jsonl, results_arithmetic.json), or create a dedicated folder and invite me to a Git repo where I can open a PR.\\n\\n3) Compute details I need from you (so I can schedule jobs)\\nPlease tell me:\\n- GPU types available (exact model names), number of GPUs, per-GPU memory (e.g., T4: 16GB, A10: 24GB, A100: 40GB/80GB, V100: 16GB).\\n- vCPU and RAM per machine (or CI runner specs).\\n- Local disk space (GB) and object storage quotas.\\n- Whether preemptible/spot instances are acceptable.\\n- Estimated monthly budget for experiments (so I can select model sizes / parallelism).\\nIf you don’t have this information, here are recommended minimal / suggested configs for the baseline and future runs:\\n\\nMinimal development (one-off runs, low cost)\\n- flan-t5-small (or t5-small): CPU OK, but a small GPU accelerates inference.\\n- Recommended machine: CPU: 8 vCPU, 32 GB RAM (for CPU-only), or 1 GPU T4/A10 with 16–24 GB VRAM.\\n- Disk: 20–50 GB.\\n- Use-case: run 50 examples zero-shot in seconds–minutes.\\n\\nModerate (code-models and 7B LLMs)\\n- GPU: A10/T4/V100 (16–24GB VRAM) for quantized 7B; A100 40GB recommended for 7B full precision.\\n- Machine: 16–32 vCPU, 64–128 GB RAM.\\n- Disk: 200 GB.\\n- Use-case: running 7B fine-tuning/eval and larger batch inference.\\n\\nLarge (13B–70B)\\n- GPU: A100 80GB or multiple A100 40GB with model parallelism; or cluster with NVLink.\\n- Machine: 32+ vCPU, 256+ GB RAM.\\n- Disk: 1 TB.\\n- Use-case: big evaluation / finetuning.\\n\\nCUDA / driver compatibility (general guidance)\\n- For PyTorch >=1.13 and CUDA 11.7/11.8, drivers >= 510 are generally required. If you plan to use Triton/accelerate or bitsandbytes, confirm CUDA 11.8 and recent NVIDIA driver versions. I can adapt to the exact CUDA/drivers you provide.\\n\\n4) Docker and CI runners (allowed? automated execution permission)\\n- I can produce:\\n  - Dockerfile that installs minimal runtime (python, torch, transformers, jsonschema, boto3/gcs).\\n  - GitHub Actions workflow that runs ingestion, validation, and stores artifacts to S3/GCS.\\nWhat I need from you:\\n- Confirm whether running Docker images in your CI is allowed.\\n- If allowed, provide a repo to push the GitHub Actions workflow or an existing branch I should open a PR against.\\n- If you want me to run CI on your infra, provide a runner or a machine with credentials.\\n- If you do not permit running external code, I will deliver Dockerfile and a GH Actions YAML you can paste into your repo.\\n\\n5) Annotator availability / privacy & compliance\\n- I don’t have in-house human annotators to assign to your project in this environment.\\n- Please confirm whether third-party annotators are permitted and whether you have vendor relationships (e.g., Scale AI, Labelbox, Appen) or an internal pool.\\nRecommendation (if you need me to organize):\\n- Requirement: 3 annotators (week-3 labeling) — 3 annotators working part-time for 1 week should be sufficient for many tasks (exact hours depend on volume).\\n- Estimated cost: typical US-based annotator rates are $20–$40/hr; vendors often charge more and provide QA. If you permit offshore contractors, rates are lower (e.g., $8–$20/hr). Provide your compliance/privacy docs if sensitive data is involved (PII restrictions, NDAs).\\nIf third-party annotators are not permitted, we will need your internal annotators or a vendor approved by your compliance team.\\n\\n6) Run schema/validate_samples.py on samples/validation.jsonl\\nCurrent status:\\n- I do not have your repo files in this environment, so I could not run validate_samples.py here.\\n- If you provide the repo zip at a download URL or give me S3/GCS read access, I will:\\n  - Extract the repo,\\n  - Run schema/validate_samples.py on samples/validation.jsonl (or create validation.jsonl by concatenating canonical validation splits if missing),\\n  - Produce validation_report.json and upload it to the provided storage path.\\nWhat I will upload (if you provide credentials):\\n- <prefix>/validation_report.json\\n- <prefix>/samples/validation.jsonl (if I created one)\\nExact command I will run (or you can run locally):\\n- (from the repo root)\\n  python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\\n  python3 schema/validate_samples.py samples/validation.jsonl --output validation_report.json\\nIf you prefer an automated uploader, I can run a script that uses boto3 or google-cloud-storage to place outputs in your bucket; please provide credentials or a presigned PUT URL.\\n\\n7) Quick baseline inference on 50 examples (flan-t5-small)\\nI cannot run the baseline here because:\\n- This environment has no internet access to download models, and I do not have cached model files available.\\nWhat I can do right now:\\n- Provide a ready-to-run script that will perform zero-shot or few-shot inference on 50 examples using transformers, and upload outputs (predictions.jsonl and results_arithmetic.json) to S3/GCS.\\n- If you provide a machine/runner with internet or provide the model files (a local Hugging Face model directory), I will run it and upload results.\\nRunnable inference script (save as run_baseline.py). You can run this locally or in CI:\\n\\n----- run_baseline.py -----\\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\\nimport json, argparse, sys\\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\\n\\ndef load_examples(path, max_examples=50):\\n    exs = []\\n    with open(path, \"r\") as f:\\n        for line in f:\\n            if len(exs) >= max_examples:\\n                break\\n            exs.append(json.loads(line))\\n    return exs\\n\\ndef main(args):\\n    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(args.model)\\n    model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(args.model).to(args.device)\\n    examples = load_examples(args.input, args.max_examples)\\n    outputs = []\\n    for ex in tqdm(examples):\\n        prompt = ex.get(\"input\") or ex.get(\"prompt\") or ex.get(\"question\")\\n        inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\", truncation=True, max_length=1024).to(args.device)\\n        out = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=256)\\n        pred = tokenizer.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\\n        outputs.append({\"id\": ex.get(\"id\"), \"input\": prompt, \"prediction\": pred})\\n    with open(args.out_pred, \"w\") as f:\\n        for o in outputs:\\n            f.write(json.dumps(o) + \"\\\\n\")\\n    print(\"Wrote predictions to\", args.out_pred)\\n\\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\\n    p = argparse.ArgumentParser()\\n    p.add_argument(\"--model\", default=\"google/flan-t5-small\")\\n    p.add_argument(\"--input\", required=True)\\n    p.add_argument(\"--out_pred\", default=\"predictions.jsonl\")\\n    p.add_argument(\"--max_examples\", type=int, default=50)\\n    p.add_argument(\"--device\", default=\"cuda\" if (False) else \"cpu\")  # change to \"cuda\" if GPU present\\n    args = p.parse_args()\\n    main(args)\\n----- end -----\\n\\nResource guidance for running this script:\\n- flan-t5-small: CPU is fine for small batches, GPU (T4/A10) speeds it up. Model size ~ 200–400MB to download. For 50 examples, CPU run is a few minutes.\\n- If device=\"cuda\" set to GPU and you have CUDA drivers that match your PyTorch build.\\n\\nHow I will compute metrics for arithmetic & code:\\n- Arithmetic: parse final_answer from model output if present; otherwise apply problem-specific checker (for GSM8K use rationales + final answer extraction).\\n- Code: for HumanEval/MBPP, use the dataset-provided unit tests or simple exec-run harness. I will run each generated function against the provided test cases and produce pass/fail per example.

(3) Draft annotation guidelines for human labelers: instructions, examples, corner cases, and a required inter-annotator agreement (IAA) target. Specify the annotation tool to use (LabelStudio/Prodigy/custom) and the minimum staffing (number of annotators, estimated hours) needed to label the initial 200 validation examples. (4) Produce a privacy/compliance checklist stating constraints for human annotation (PII handling, data retention, consent) and confirm whether in-house or third-party annotators are allowed. (5) Output: (A) evaluation_rubric.md (and a JSON/CSV mapping of metrics), (B) annotator_guidelines.md, and (C) a short runbook describing how to validate the samples with schema/validate_samples.py and how to submit annotated examples back into the repo (format and S3/GCS path). Also, immediately request from coder the current compute/storage/repo-access details (GPU types, S3/GCS path, repo push access) and confirm availability of 3 annotators for the Week-3 labeling task.

Human-readable evaluation_rubric.md (draft)\\n(Entire .md content below; you can copy-paste into evaluation_rubric.md)\\n\\n---\\n\\nevaluation_rubric.md (DRAFT)\\n\\nOverview\\n- This document maps each target task to one or more evaluation metrics, specifies conservative and ambitious thresholds, and gives exact computation guidance (scripts/pseudocode). Use these metrics on the validation set unless noted otherwise.\\n\\nAssumptions\\n- The \"spec\" includes standard metrics: Exact Match (EM), Numeric Tolerance, Denotation Accuracy, Execution Accuracy / Unit-Tests pass rate, pass@k, BLEU/ROUGE for free-form text.\\n- Predictions are provided as a JSONL file with one object per line with at minimum fields: id, prediction (string), and optionally samples (for pass@k).\\n\\n1) Arithmetic / Math\\n- Primary metric: Numeric Exact Match within tolerance (EM_num).\\n  - Conservative threshold: 90% validation EM_num\\n  - Ambitious threshold: 98% validation EM_num\\n- Secondary metric: Average Absolute Error (MAE) or relative error for regression-style tasks.\\n  - Conservative: MAE <= 0.02 * |mean_gold|\\n  - Ambitious: MAE <= 0.005 * |mean_gold|\\n\\nHow to compute:\\n- For each example:\\n  - If gold has numeric_tolerance: use that.\\n  - Else default: absolute tolerance = 1e-6 for integers, or relative=1e-6 for floats.\\n- EM_num = fraction of examples where |pred - gold| <= max(absolute_tolerance, relative_tolerance * |gold|)\\n- MAE = mean(|pred - gold|)\\n\\nPseudocode:\\n- See evaluation_scripts/compute_arithmetic_metrics.py\\n  - parse predictions and gold\\n  - coerce to numeric (handle strings like \"45\", \"45.0\", \"45 +/- 1\")\\n  - evaluate using tolerances\\n\\nCommand (example):\\npython evaluation_scripts/compute_arithmetic_metrics.py \\\\\\n  --pred predictions.jsonl \\\\\\n  --gold samples/validation.jsonl \\\\\\n  --out results_arithmetic.json\\n\\n2) Code generation\\n- Primary metric: Execution Accuracy (unit tests pass rate)\\n  - Conservative (pass rate on unit tests): 40% (pass@1)\\n  - Ambitious: 70% (pass@1)\\n- Secondary metric: pass@k (for sampling-based models), where k is typically 5 or 10.\\n  - Conservative pass@5 >= 55%\\n  - Ambitious pass@5 >= 85%\\n- Safety metric: sandbox escape rate = 0\\n\\nHow to compute:\\n- For each problem with N candidate predictions (N≥1):\\n  - If unit tests provided: attempt to run candidate code in sandbox; mark success if all tests pass.\\n  - Execution Accuracy = fraction of problems where at least one candidate passes tests (for pass@k, compute fraction with any pass among k samples).\\n- pass@k formula (for sampled outputs with n independent samples and c successes) — use standard closed-form estimate:\\n  - pass@k = 1 - comb(n-c,k)/comb(n,k)   (for exact formula when sampling w/o replacement)\\n  - If you have only one sample, pass@1 = fraction of single-sample that passes.\\n\\nPseudocode for running tests:\\n- For each example:\\n  - create ephemeral container with required language/runtime\\n  - install dependencies\\n  - run tests with timeout and resource limits (no network)\\n  - capture stdout/stderr and exit code\\n  - mark pass if tests exit with code 0 and expected outputs match\\n\\nCommand (example):\\n# sandbox runner (requires Docker + test harness)\\npython evaluation_scripts/run_code_tests.py \\\\\\n  --pred candidates.jsonl \\\\\\n  --gold samples/validation.jsonl \\\\\\n  --max-workers 8 \\\\\\n  --timeout 30 \\\\\\n  --out results_code.json\\n\\nNotes:\\n- If running code in CI is disallowed, fallback is to run static checks (compilation, simple outputs), or human evaluation.\\n\\n3) Semantic parsing (text -> MR/SQL)\\n- Primary metric: Denotation Accuracy (DA) — run MR against canonical database and compare results\\n  - Conservative threshold: 75% denotation accuracy\\n  - Ambitious threshold: 95% denotation accuracy\\n- Secondary metric: Exact Match (EM) on normalized MR (after canonicalization)\\n  - Conservative: 60%\\n  - Ambitious: 90%\\n\\nHow to compute:\\n- If executor_config / DB snapshot is available:\\n  - Run MR and normalize returned results; comparison is set-equality (order-insensitive) unless domain requires order.\\n- If no executable environment, use normalized string EM on canonical_form (tokenization & canonicalization steps must be specified)\\n\\nCommand (example):\\npython evaluation_scripts/compute_denotation_accuracy.py \\\\\\n  --pred predictions.jsonl \\\\\\n  --gold samples/validation.jsonl \\\\\\n  --db snapshots/mysql_validation.db \\\\\\n  --out results_semparse.json\\n\\n4) Explanation / Chain-of-Thought (CoT) quality rubric\\n- Metric: Human-rated CoT quality 1-5 scale (see rubric below). For aggregate metrics, report average score and % >= 4.\\n\\nCoT rubric (1–5)\\n- 5 (Excellent): Correct final answer; step-by-step reasoning is logically correct, complete, concise, and would allow an expert to verify each step. No hallucinations. Example: clear algebra steps with each transformation explicitly stated and correct.\\n- 4 (Good): Correct final answer; reasoning mostly correct with minor omissions or small inefficiencies, but no incorrect steps that affect final answer.\\n- 3 (Acceptable): Final answer correct but reasoning has several gaps or unclear steps that require filling in; or reasoning mostly correct but contains a minor incorrect inference that doesn\\'t affect final.\\n- 2 (Poor): Final answer possibly correct (or incorrect); reasoning contains major mistakes or unjustified leaps; steps are ambiguous or contradictory.\\n- 1 (Bad): Final answer incorrect and reasoning is wrong, incoherent, or hallucinated.\\n\\nCoT rubric examples (short)\\n- Example (5): \"To solve 2x+3=7: subtract 3 => 2x=4 => x=2.\"\\n- Example (3): \"Solve: 2x+3=7. So x=4/2=2.\" (skips subtraction explicit mention)\\n- Example (1): \"x=7+3/2=5.5\" (incorrect step)\\n\\nCoT scoring instructions for annotators:\\n- Check correctness of each reasoning step.\\n- Check whether any step uses unsupported facts.\\n- Check clarity & sufficiency.\\n\\n5) Aggregation reporting\\n- Provide overall metrics per-task and broken down by difficulty, source, or length buckets (e.g., prompt length).\\n- Provide confusion analysis and sample failures.\\n\\nMachine-readable mapping (JSON)\\n- Provided below as \"evaluation_metrics.json\".\\n\\n---\\n\\nB.

They will also correct or provide canonical answers when asked.\\n\\nGeneral instructions\\n1. Read the prompt and gold/reference carefully.\\n2. For each model response, answer the required fields in the annotation UI:\\n   - final_answer_correct? (Yes/No)\\n   - final_answer_normalized (text)\\n   - reason_steps_quality (1–5)\\n   - notes (free text)\\n   - any safety/PII concerns? (Yes/No + comment)\\n3. Use gold references and test harnesses where available. If a task includes a run/test harness, use it rather than manual inspection to assess correctness.\\n\\nSpecific instructions per task\\n\\nArithmetic tasks\\n- Normalize numerical answers: strip commas, normal scientific notation accepted.\\n- Use numeric tolerances provided in example; if none provided:\\n  - default absolute tolerance = 1e-6 for floats;\\n  - for integer expected_format, enforce exact integer match.\\n- If multiple answers are acceptable, select “Yes” if prediction matches any acceptable answer after normalization.\\n- Edge cases:\\n  - Answers like \"45 (approx.)\" should be considered correct if within tolerance.\\n  - If units are required (e.g., meters), check units; missing unit is incorrect if unit was explicitly required.\\n\\nCode tasks\\n- Attempt to run candidate code in the provided sandbox runner (tests provided).\\n- Mark final_answer_correct only if code passes all unit tests or matches expected outputs for provided inputs.\\n- If unit tests cannot run (external dependencies/network/etc.), annotate as \"Cannot Auto-Evaluate\" and provide manual review notes:\\n  - Does the code compile?\\n  - Are obvious security issues present (e.g., os.system with network/exec)?\\n- For subtle correctness issues (time complexity, edge cases), annotate notes and mark rating accordingly.\\n\\nSemantic parsing\\n- If an executor and DB snapshot exist, prefer denotation check: run MR and compare result set to gold denotation.\\n- If only canonical MR is available, perform canonicalization (strip whitespace, normalized aliases) then exact-match on tokens.\\n- For ambiguous queries, record whether multiple MRs would be acceptable and annotate accordingly.\\n\\nCoT (Chain-of-Thought) rating (1–5)\\n- See rubric in evaluation_rubric.md. Rate reasoning on logical validity, completeness, clarity, and lack of hallucination.\\n- Examples:\\n  - 5: Step-by-step derivation with correct transformations.\\n  - 3: Correct answer but skipped intermediate steps or not sufficient to reproduce work.\\n  - 1: Incorrect logic leading to wrong answer or hallucinated facts.\\n\\nAnnotation UI fields (recommended fields)\\n- example_id (immutable)\\n- annotator_id\\n- timestamp\\n- final_correct (yes/no/cannot_evaluate)\\n- final_answer_normalized (text)\\n- cot_rating (1..5)\\n- cot_comments (text)\\n- eval_notes (text)\\n- privacy_flag (true/false)\\n- reviewer_needed (true/false if disagreement)\\n\\nCorner cases and decision rules\\n- Multiple correct outputs: mark as correct if any predicted output equals any gold reference after normalization; document ambiguous cases.\\n- Non-deterministic problems: If code can produce different but valid outputs, consult gold denotation or mark as manual-review.\\n- Incomplete CoT: if CoT contains correct steps but omits step notation between two heavy leaps, rate 3.\\n- Safety/PII: If prompt or output contains PII, tag privacy_flag and do not copy PII into external tools.\\n\\nInter-annotator agreement and adjudication\\n- Required target: Cohen\\'s kappa >= 0.8 for categorical final_correct, Krippendorff\\'s alpha >= 0.8 for CoT rating aggregation (or equivalent).\\n- Annotation plan:\\n  - Each example will be double-annotated (2 annotators).\\n  - Disagreements on final_correct or cot_rating escalated to a 3rd annotator (adjudicator).\\n  - Adjudicator final decision recorded.\\n\\nAnnotator training and qualification\\n- Provide a one-hour training session with examples and calibration task of 20 sample examples. Expect annotator qualification with >=85% agreement on calibration set.\\n- Provide an annotation manual with examples and quick decision rules (this document).\\n\\nAnnotation throughput and staffing estimate (for 200 validation examples)\\n- Average annotation times (estimates):\\n  - Arithmetic example: 1.5–3.0 minutes\\n  - Semantic parse: 3–6 minutes (denotation or normalization)\\n  - Code (with auto-tests): 4–8 minutes if auto-run works; 8–20 minutes if manual review is needed\\n  - CoT rating: 1–3 minutes\\n\\nStaffing plan (200 examples)\\n- Required annotators: 3 annotators total (to enable double annotation + adjudication):\\n  - Each example annotated twice (2 annotations) -> 400 annotation instances.\\n  - With 3 annotators, distribute ~133 annotation instances per annotator.\\n- Time per annotator estimate (average across tasks ~4 minutes per annotation):\\n  - 133 * 4 min = ~532 minutes ≈ 8.9 hours\\n  - Add 2 hours for training/calibration + 1 hour for review = ~12 hours/annotator\\n- Adjudication:\\n  - Expect ~15–25% disagreements (estimate) -> ~30–50 adjudication cases (3rd annotator time included above as distributed).\\n- Minimum staffing: 3 annotators trained and available; 1 project manager for QC (part-time).\\n\\nAnnotation tool recommendation\\n- Recommended: LabelStudio (open-source, free/community) — supports multi-annotator workflows, double-annotation, custom schemas, export to JSONL/CSV, role-based access.\\n- Alternative: Prodigy (paid) if you prefer active learning and faster interface.\\n- Rationale for LabelStudio:\\n  - Easy to install and host internally\\n  - Supports multiple users, assignments, overlaps for IAA\\n  - Export in JSON or CSV for ingestion\\n\\nLabelStudio configuration notes\\n- Create a project per task (arithmetic, code, semantic parsing).\\n- Define schema matching the required output fields (final_correct, final_answer_normalized, cot_rating, etc.)\\n- Use assignment overlaps (set overlap to 2) to get double annotation per example.\\n- Set up an adjudication workflow for disagreements.\\n\\nPART 4 — Privacy / compliance checklist (for human annotators)\\n\\nPrivacy and compliance checklist\\n- PII handling:\\n  - Prohibit annotators from exporting, downloading, or copying PII outside the annotation environment.\\n  - Redact or hash PII in stored examples where possible (names, emails, phone numbers, SSNs).\\n  - If an example necessitates PII exposure for correctness, log the minimal access and restrict to vetted annotators.\\n- Data minimization:\\n  - Only present necessary fields to annotators.\\n  - Use reduced context or obfuscated PII for training if possible.\\n- Consent and provenance:\\n  - Ensure dataset sources have appropriate licenses and consent for human review.\\n  - Maintain an audit trail: who accessed which sample and when.\\n- Data retention:\\n  - Define retention policy (e.g., annotations stored for X months); archive or delete raw PII within Y days post-annotation.\\n- Secure storage:\\n  - Store annotations and samples in encrypted storage (S3 with SSE or GCS with CMEK).\\n  - Enforce least privilege access; use role-based access management.\\n- Legal controls:\\n  - When using third-party annotators, require NDAs and Data Processing Agreements (DPA).\\n  - Verify third parties meet security standards (SOC2, ISO27001) if they will handle sensitive content.\\n- Audit and monitoring:\\n  - Log accesses, and run regular audits.\\n  - Randomly sample annotator work for QA.\\n\\nThird-party vs in-house annotators\\n- Recommendation: Prefer in-house annotators for any PII or sensitive content.\\n- Third-party: allowed only if:\\n  - They sign NDAs and DPA\\n  - They meet security certifications\\n  - Data is appropriately minimized/obfuscated\\n- Please confirm organizational policy; I cannot make the legal determination.\\n\\nPART 5 — Runbook (validate samples and submission instructions)\\n\\nrunbook (short) — to include in runbook.md or included below\\n\\n1) Validating samples locally with schema/validate_samples.py\\n- Prereqs:\\n  - Python 3.9+\\n  - Install requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt\\n  - (Optional) virtualenv\\n- Example command:\\npython schema/validate_samples.py --schema schema/schema.json --samples samples/validation.jsonl --out validation_report.json\\n\\n- Expected output:\\n  - validation_report.json containing per-sample pass/fail and a summary of missing fields, type errors, and normalization warnings.\\n- Common fixes:\\n  - Type mismatches: convert numeric strings to numbers or vice versa according to schema.\\n  - Missing fields: populate defaults or add fields into ingestion scripts.\\n\\n2) Running the evaluation scripts (example commands)\\n- Arithmetic:\\npython evaluation_scripts/compute_arithmetic_metrics.py --pred predictions.jsonl --gold samples/validation.jsonl --out results_arithmetic.json\\n\\n- Code:\\npython evaluation_scripts/run_code_tests.py --pred candidates.jsonl --gold samples/validation.jsonl --max-workers 8 --timeout 30 --out results_code.json\\n\\n- Semantic parsing:\\npython evaluation_scripts/compute_denotation_accuracy.py --pred predictions.jsonl --gold samples/validation.jsonl --db snapshots/validation.db --out results_semparse.json\\n\\n3) Submitting annotated examples back into repo / storage\\n- Format:\\n  - Output JSONL with one object per line, fields:\\n    - id (string)\\n    - annotation: {\\n        annotator_id: string,\\n        final_correct: bool|null,\\n        final_answer_normalized: string|null,\\n        cot_rating: int|null,\\n        cot_comments: string|null,\\n        privacy_flag: bool,\\n        validation_status: \"annotated\"|\"adjudicated\"|\"rejected\"\\n      }\\n  - Keep original example fields present to allow re-ingestion.\\n- Filename convention: annotations/<task>/annotator_<annotatorid>_<YYYYMMDD>.jsonl\\n- Submission paths:\\n  - Preferred: S3 path: s3://<BUCKET>/dataset/annotations/<task>/<filename>.jsonl\\n  - Alternative: GCS path: gs://<BUCKET>/dataset/annotations/<task>/<filename>.jsonl\\n  - Alternatively, push to repo branch: repo/annotations/<task>/<filename>.jsonl (if data size permits)\\n- Upload checklist:\\n  - Validate JSONL schema with schema/validate_samples.py (or a dedicated validator that checks annotation structure)\\n  - Ensure encryption and role permissions on the target bucket\\n  - Notify repo owner/CI with a PR or ticket linking the new annotation file\\n\\n4) CI / PR integration (recommended)\\n- Add a CI step that runs schema/validate_samples.py on new annotation files in PRs and fails if schema checks fail.\\n- Add automatic metrics computation when annotated validation set is updated.\\n\\nDeliverable files I will produce\\n- evaluation_rubric.md (content above)\\n- evaluation_metrics.json (content above)\\n- evaluation_metrics.csv (content above)\\n- annotator_guidelines.md (content above)\\n- runbook.md (content above plus commands specific to your scripts once I can inspect them)\\n\\nImmediate requests from coder (required to proceed)\\nPlease provide these items ASAP so I can complete the verification and run the validations within 3 business days:\\n1) Grant read (and if allowed, write) access to the repository OR upload the following files here:\\n   - schema/schema.json\\n   - samples/*.jsonl (validation/seed/test splits)\\n   - ingestion_scripts/ (or schema/validate_samples.py)\\n   - any evaluation scripts already present (evaluation_scripts/)\\n2) Compute & storage details:\\n   - Do you have GPU-based machines for model inference?

Provide target path and write permissions.\\n   - Confirm whether I may push the evaluation scripts and CI changes (if not, I will produce PR-ready patches).\\n4) Annotator availability:\\n   - Please confirm availability of 3 annotators for Week-3 labeling task (names or yes/no). If not available, say how many are available and whether contractors can be engaged.\\n\\nPotential constraints and proposed mitigations\\n- Constraint: No repo access / missing files -> I cannot validate schema or run validator.\\n  - Mitigation: Provide files or grant access, or paste schema here.\\n- Constraint: Running code tests in your environment may be disallowed (security).\\n  - Mitigation: Use a separate isolated evaluation cluster (air-gapped), or use static analysis + manual review for code.\\n- Constraint: PII or legal prohibitions against third-party annotators.\\n  - Mitigation: Use vetted in-house annotators or hire third-party under DPA and limited redacted datasets.\\n- Constraint: No sandbox/container runner to execute code tasks.\\n  - Mitigation: Create Docker images per language or use existing open-source runners; if impossible, rely on unit test heuristics / human evaluation.\\n- Constraint: No DB snapshots for semantic parsing denotation evaluation.\\n  - Mitigation: Build small canonical DB fixtures for evaluation; fallback to normalized EM with clear acceptance criteria.\\n\\nNext steps I will take once you reply with requested access/info\\n1.

If you plan to use Triton/accelerate or bitsandbytes, confirm CUDA 11.8 and recent NVIDIA driver versions. I can adapt to the exact CUDA/drivers you provide.\\n\\n4) Docker and CI runners (allowed? automated execution permission)\\n- I can produce:\\n  - Dockerfile that installs minimal runtime (python, torch, transformers, jsonschema, boto3/gcs).\\n  - GitHub Actions workflow that runs ingestion, validation, and stores artifacts to S3/GCS.\\nWhat I need from you:\\n- Confirm whether running Docker images in your CI is allowed.\\n- If allowed, provide a repo to push the GitHub Actions workflow or an existing branch I should open a PR against.\\n- If you want me to run CI on your infra, provide a runner or a machine with credentials.\\n- If you do not permit running external code, I will deliver Dockerfile and a GH Actions YAML you can paste into your repo.\\n\\n5) Annotator availability / privacy & compliance\\n- I don’t have in-house human annotators to assign to your project in this environment.\\n- Please confirm whether third-party annotators are permitted and whether you have vendor relationships (e.g., Scale AI, Labelbox, Appen) or an internal pool.\\nRecommendation (if you need me to organize):\\n- Requirement: 3 annotators (week-3 labeling) — 3 annotators working part-time for 1 week should be sufficient for many tasks (exact hours depend on volume).\\n- Estimated cost: typical US-based annotator rates are $20–$40/hr; vendors often charge more and provide QA. If you permit offshore contractors, rates are lower (e.g., $8–$20/hr). Provide your compliance/privacy docs if sensitive data is involved (PII restrictions, NDAs).\\nIf third-party annotators are not permitted, we will need your internal annotators or a vendor approved by your compliance team.\\n\\n6) Run schema/validate_samples.py on samples/validation.jsonl\\nCurrent status:\\n- I do not have your repo files in this environment, so I could not run validate_samples.py here.\\n- If you provide the repo zip at a download URL or give me S3/GCS read access, I will:\\n  - Extract the repo,\\n  - Run schema/validate_samples.py on samples/validation.jsonl (or create validation.jsonl by concatenating canonical validation splits if missing),\\n  - Produce validation_report.json and upload it to the provided storage path.\\nWhat I will upload (if you provide credentials):\\n- <prefix>/validation_report.json\\n- <prefix>/samples/validation.jsonl (if I created one)\\nExact command I will run (or you can run locally):\\n- (from the repo root)\\n  python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\\n  python3 schema/validate_samples.py samples/validation.jsonl --output validation_report.json\\nIf you prefer an automated uploader, I can run a script that uses boto3 or google-cloud-storage to place outputs in your bucket; please provide credentials or a presigned PUT URL.\\n\\n7) Quick baseline inference on 50 examples (flan-t5-small)\\nI cannot run the baseline here because:\\n- This environment has no internet access to download models, and I do not have cached model files available.\\nWhat I can do right now:\\n- Provide a ready-to-run script that will perform zero-shot or few-shot inference on 50 examples using transformers, and upload outputs (predictions.jsonl and results_arithmetic.json) to S3/GCS.\\n- If you provide a machine/runner with internet or provide the model files (a local Hugging Face model directory), I will run it and upload results.\\nRunnable inference script (save as run_baseline.py).

For 50 examples, CPU run is a few minutes.\\n- If device=\"cuda\" set to GPU and you have CUDA drivers that match your PyTorch build.\\n\\nHow I will compute metrics for arithmetic & code:\\n- Arithmetic: parse final_answer from model output if present; otherwise apply problem-specific checker (for GSM8K use rationales + final answer extraction).\\n- Code: for HumanEval/MBPP, use the dataset-provided unit tests or simple exec-run harness. I will run each generated function against the provided test cases and produce pass/fail per example. This requires a secure sandbox (Docker runner) or a safe environment to execute untrusted code.\\n\\nSecurity note about executing model-generated code\\n- Executing arbitrary model-generated code requires sandboxing. If you permit me to run code execution on your provided VM or CI runner, please confirm that a Docker runner or isolated environment is approved. Otherwise I will only produce predictions and the tests as artifacts for you to run in your environment.\\n\\nDeliverables I will produce once you provide access (timeline)\\n- Within 24 hours after you provide repo zip or repo push access:\\n  - Extract and run schema/validate_samples.py on samples/validation.jsonl (or create validation.jsonl by concatenating splits), produce validation_report.json and upload to your S3/GCS location.\\n  - If requested, open a PR (or push) with Dockerfile and GitHub Actions workflows for ingestion & validation.\\n- Within 48 hours after you provide storage creds and compute (or model files):\\n  - Run baseline inference on 50 examples using flan-t5-small and upload predictions.jsonl and results_arithmetic.json (metrics summary).\\n- If any of the above are blocked by missing access, I will provide a ready-to-run command set and helper scripts (upload / s3/gcs uploader) and can assist your engineer to run them.\\n\\nExact information I need from you now to proceed within 3 business days\\n1) Choose one repo access method (A or B above) and provide the artifact (signed URL, upload, or repo invite).\\n2) Provide S3/GCS credentials (temporary preferred) or presigned PUT URLs for:\\n   - <prefix>/validation_report.json\\n   - <prefix>/predictions.jsonl\\n   - <prefix>/results_arithmetic.json\\n3) Tell me which compute option you will provide (or say you want me to run in your cloud) and whether preemptible instances are allowed.\\n4) Confirm whether I am allowed to run Docker containers and execute generated code in your environment (sandbox requirement).\\n5) Confirm annotator policy (do you have 3 annotators or do you want me to recommend vendors and manage the vendor onboarding?).\\n6) If you prefer I run validation/baseline, grant a short-lived credential set or provide the download URL for the repo zip now.\\n\\nIf you want me to proceed immediately and run validation here\\n- Provide a direct download URL to the repo zip (HTTP(S) link) or upload the zip to /mnt/data via the shared storage you control (or give me an S3 presigned GET URL).\\nOnce I receive the zip, I will:\\n- Extract repo,\\n- Run validate_samples.py on samples/validation.jsonl and write validation_report.json,\\n- Upload report to your storage (if you provided credentials) or supply it here for download.\\n\\nUseful helper snippets (you can paste into your shell)\\n\\nA) Validate locally (one-liner)\\npython3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt && python3 schema/validate_samples.py samples/validation.jsonl --output validation_report.json\\n\\nB) Upload validation_report.json to S3 (bash; using AWS CLI)\\naws s3 cp validation_report.json s3://your-bucket/ingestion/validation_report.json\\n\\nC) Upload to GCS (bash; using gsutil)\\ngsutil cp validation_report.json gs://your-bucket/ingestion/validation_report.json\\n\\nD) Minimal IAM policy for S3 (create a scoped user; replace your-bucket)\\n{\\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\\n  \"Statement\": [\\n    {\\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\\n      \"Action\": [\"s3:PutObject\",\"s3:GetObject\"],\\n      \"Resource\": [\"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/ingestion/*\"]\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\nNext steps — please pick one\\n- Option 1 (fastest): Provide a presigned GET URL to the repo zip and an S3 presigned PUT URL or temporary credentials.

If you permit offshore contractors, rates are lower (e.g., $8–$20/hr). Provide your compliance/privacy docs if sensitive data is involved (PII restrictions, NDAs).\\nIf third-party annotators are not permitted, we will need your internal annotators or a vendor approved by your compliance team.\\n\\n6) Run schema/validate_samples.py on samples/validation.jsonl\\nCurrent status:\\n- I do not have your repo files in this environment, so I could not run validate_samples.py here.\\n- If you provide the repo zip at a download URL or give me S3/GCS read access, I will:\\n  - Extract the repo,\\n  - Run schema/validate_samples.py on samples/validation.jsonl (or create validation.jsonl by concatenating canonical validation splits if missing),\\n  - Produce validation_report.json and upload it to the provided storage path.\\nWhat I will upload (if you provide credentials):\\n- <prefix>/validation_report.json\\n- <prefix>/samples/validation.jsonl (if I created one)\\nExact command I will run (or you can run locally):\\n- (from the repo root)\\n  python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\\n  python3 schema/validate_samples.py samples/validation.jsonl --output validation_report.json\\nIf you prefer an automated uploader, I can run a script that uses boto3 or google-cloud-storage to place outputs in your bucket; please provide credentials or a presigned PUT URL.\\n\\n7) Quick baseline inference on 50 examples (flan-t5-small)\\nI cannot run the baseline here because:\\n- This environment has no internet access to download models, and I do not have cached model files available.\\nWhat I can do right now:\\n- Provide a ready-to-run script that will perform zero-shot or few-shot inference on 50 examples using transformers, and upload outputs (predictions.jsonl and results_arithmetic.json) to S3/GCS.\\n- If you provide a machine/runner with internet or provide the model files (a local Hugging Face model directory), I will run it and upload results.\\nRunnable inference script (save as run_baseline.py).

I will run each generated function against the provided test cases and produce pass/fail per example. This requires a secure sandbox (Docker runner) or a safe environment to execute untrusted code.\\n\\nSecurity note about executing model-generated code\\n- Executing arbitrary model-generated code requires sandboxing.

I can, however, (A) run the validation and baselines and upload results as soon as you provide either (i) temporary credentials (S3 or GCS service account key), (ii) presigned PUT URLs for the output files, or (iii) a direct HTTP(S) GET URL to the repo zip so I can pull the repo and run locally. If you provide any one of those within 3 business days I will run the tasks and upload artifacts within the time windows below.\\n- If you cannot or will not provide credentials, I will deliver ready-to-run artifacts (scripts, Dockerfile, GH Actions workflow, and exact commands) within 24 hours so your verifier or CI can execute them locally.\\n\\nBelow I list each requested item, what I can and cannot do here, exactly what I need from you (format & minimal permissions), and fallback/mitigation options and timelines.\\n\\n1) Repo access / shared repo zip\\n- Status here: I cannot grant or accept read/write repo access from this environment or push to your repo.\\n- What I need from you (pick one):\\n  - Option A — Grant repo read (or read+write) access:\\n    - Add a service account / bot as a collaborator, or provide a deploy key with push rights. If you want PRs only, invite my GitHub handle and I will prepare a PR patch.\\n    - If you prefer, tell me the repo URL and desired target branch for a PR.\\n  - Option B — Upload repo zip and give me a presigned GET URL (HTTP(S)) or point me to an S3/GCS location I can read:\\n    - Example filename: ingestion_repo.zip or dataset_ingestion_repo.zip.\\n    - Provide a presigned GET URL or make file publicly accessible for the short time needed.\\n- Alternative (if you do not want to share creds): I will produce a zip with updated scripts and CI artifacts and attach it here for you to download and run.

I will supply the files and instructions.\\n\\n3) Compute details I need from you\\n- I cannot inspect your infra from here. Please provide the exact compute resources you will allocate so I can plan which baselines to run. Tell me:\\n  - GPU model(s) and counts (e.g., 1x NVIDIA T4, 2x A10, 4x A100-80GB).\\n  - Per-GPU memory (e.g., T4: 16GB, A100: 40GB/80GB).\\n  - vCPU and RAM per machine (e.g., 16 vCPU / 64 GB RAM).\\n  - Disk space available (GB).\\n  - CUDA / driver versions (if available).\\n  - Whether preemptible/spot instances are acceptable.\\n  - Monthly budget constraint (approx $ / month) if you want me to constrain experiments.\\n- Recommended minimal configurations (for you to select):\\n  - For quick baseline (flan-t5-small; 50 examples): CPU-only (8 vCPU, 32 GB RAM) is OK; GPU (T4/A10 with 16–24 GB) recommended to speed up.\\n  - For code models / 350M–2B: single GPU with 16–24 GB VRAM (T4/A10/V100) OR quantized 7B on 24GB with bitsandbytes techniques.\\n  - For larger evaluation / finetuning: A100-40GB (or A100-80GB cluster).\\n- My plan depending on what you provide:\\n  - If you give me a GPU-enabled VM (SSH or CI runner) and storage creds, I will run baseline inference and code-execution tests in a sandboxed Docker container.\\n\\n4) Docker & CI runners; permission to execute sandboxed code\\n- I need explicit confirmation whether you allow:\\n  - Docker image builds and container execution in your environment or CI runners.\\n  - Automated sandboxed execution of model-generated code (required to run HumanEval / MBPP unit tests). This must be on a machine you approve because it executes untrusted code.\\n- If you approve, I will:\\n  - Provide a Dockerfile that sets up a minimal runtime with python, torch, transformers, jsonschema, boto3/gsutil, and a small entrypoint to run ingestion/validation/baseline steps.\\n  - Provide a GitHub Actions workflow or equivalent to run ingestion and validation and upload artifacts.\\n- If you do not approve automated execution of code, I will run only non-executable checks (schema validation, tokenization) and deliver predictions; you (or an approved runner) will need to run the code tests.\\n\\n5) Run schema/validate_samples.py on samples/validation.jsonl\\n- I can do this and upload validation_report.json as soon as you provide either:\\n  - Readable repo zip (presigned GET) plus a presigned PUT URL or storage creds for uploading result, OR\\n  - Direct credentials (S3/GCS) so I can upload.\\n- If you prefer to run it yourself, run locally with these exact commands:\\n  - Install deps (in a venv): python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\\n  - Run validation:\\n    python3 schema/validate_samples.py samples/validation.jsonl --output validation_report.json\\n  - Upload to S3:\\n    aws s3 cp validation_report.json s3://your-bucket/ingestion/validation_report.json\\n  - Upload to GCS:\\n    gsutil cp validation_report.json gs://your-bucket/ingestion/validation_report.json\\n- Timeline if you provide creds:\\n  - I will run validation and upload validation_report.json within 24 hours of receiving credentials/presigned URLs.\\n\\n6) Quick baseline inference (50 examples) using flan-t5-small\\n- I cannot download models or run inference in this environment (no internet / model cache). I will run it for you if you provide:\\n  - A machine (SSH/CI runner) with internet and GPU (or CPU) access and the storage creds/presigned PUT URLs.\\n  - OR a local copy of the model directory (Hugging Face style) uploaded to your storage and read access granted.\\n- If you provide access, I will:\\n  - Run zero-shot generation on 50 examples from samples/validation.jsonl using google/flan-t5-small (or another specified small model).\\n  - Produce predictions.jsonl (one JSON object per line: {id, input, prediction, metadata}) and a small results file results_arithmetic.json containing per-example pass/fail and summary accuracy for arithmetic tasks.\\n  - Upload predictions.jsonl and results_arithmetic.json to the storage prefix you provide.\\n- Timeline if you provide compute & storage:\\n  - I will run and upload baseline outputs within 48 hours.\\n- If you do not provide compute, I will deliver a fully-tested run_baseline.py script and a Dockerfile so your verifier can run it. The commands will be exact and reproducible.\\n\\n7) Annotator availability and privacy/compliance\\n- I do not have in-house annotators to assign to your Week-3 labeling task.\\n- Please confirm whether third-party annotators / vendors are allowed. Suggested options:\\n  - Use an approved vendor you already contract with (Scale AI, Appen, Labelbox) — I can prepare the labeling spec and upload job manifests.\\n  - If you want me to coordinate a vendor, provide procurement/compliance approval. Vendor onboarding usually takes 3–7 business days for small projects.\\n- Privacy/compliance: tell me:\\n  - Are there PII restrictions? (Yes/No)\\n  - Do annotators need to sign NDAs / DPAs? (Yes/No)\\n  - Any dataset-specific rules (no data leaving premises, no offshore annotators, HIPAA/PCI requirements)?\\n- Estimates:\\n  - 3 annotators for 1 week (part-time) should be available if you arrange vendor or internal staff. Cost ranges widely; typical contractor rates $8–40/hr depending on region and skill.\\n- If third-party annotators are not allowed, timeline extension: please provide internal annotators and their availability. I will provide annotation UI templates and manifest files.\\n\\nIf any item cannot be provided, here are explicit statements + mitigations\\n- I cannot create or provide repo credentials, S3/GCS creds, or upload files from this environment. Mitigation:\\n  - Provide presigned PUT URLs or temporary credentials OR I will deliver runnable artifacts that you run locally/CI.\\n- I cannot run the validation or baseline without either (A) the repo zip with the samples and code, or (B) access to your repo/runner with network to download models. Mitigation:\\n  - Provide the repo zip or runner; otherwise run the commands I supply locally.\\n- I do not have annotators. Mitigation:\\n  - I will prepare the labeling spec, task instructions, and data manifests so an internal or vendor team can onboard quickly.\\n\\nExact commands & small scripts you can run right now (copy/paste)\\n- Validate samples locally (one-liner):\\n  python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt && python3 schema/validate_samples.py samples/validation.jsonl --output validation_report.json\\n- Upload to S3:\\n  aws s3 cp validation_report.json s3://your-bucket/ingestion/validation_report.json\\n- Run a 50-example baseline locally (example script saved as run_baseline.py; you can run after installing deps):\\n  python3 run_baseline.py --model google/flan-t5-small --input samples/validation.jsonl --out_pred predictions.jsonl --max_examples 50 --device cpu\\n- Minimal run_baseline.py (I will add to repo or paste into a file for you):\\n  - Loads model via Hugging Face transformers, generates output, writes predictions.jsonl.\\n\\nSecurity note about executing model-generated code\\n- Running generated code (HumanEval/MBPP) requires a sandbox (Docker container with resource limits) or a secure VM. Please confirm you approve sandboxed execution on an approved runner (I will provide a Docker container to isolate execution). If you do not permit this, I will only generate predictions and provide unit-test harnesses for you to run.\\n\\nProposed timeline once you provide required artifacts/permissions\\n- If you provide presigned GET for repo zip + presigned PUTs or credentials now:\\n  - Within 24 hours: run schema validation and upload validation_report.json.\\n  - Within 48 hours: run baseline inference (50 examples) and upload predictions.jsonl and results_arithmetic.json.\\n- If you cannot provide creds:\\n  - Within 24 hours: I will produce the final repo zip (scripts, Dockerfile, GH Actions YAML) and attach it here for your verifier to run. You will run the validation/baseline on your side with the provided exact commands.\\n\\nNext steps / what I need from you right now (choose one)\\n1) Provide a presigned GET URL to the repo zip and presigned PUT URLs for these files:\\n   - validation_report.json\\n   - predictions.jsonl\\n   - results_arithmetic.json (or results_*.json)\\n   If you supply these, I will execute and upload results within 48 hours.\\nOR\\n2) Provide temporary S3 credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID / AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY / bucket/prefix) or a GCS service account key; I will run and upload within 24–48 hours.\\nOR\\n3) If credentials are not allowed, ask me to upload a new repo zip (with Dockerfile and CI) here in the chat within 24 hours that your verifier can run; I will produce that immediately.\\n\\nIf you tell me which option you prefer I will proceed immediately and report back with precise confirmation and expected upload URLs/timestamps.'}], 'author_name': 'CoderAgent', 'additional_properties': {}}\n",

Human-readable evaluation_rubric.md (draft)\\n(Entire .md content below; you can copy-paste into evaluation_rubric.md)\\n\\n---\\n\\nevaluation_rubric.md (DRAFT)\\n\\nOverview\\n- This document maps each target task to one or more evaluation metrics, specifies conservative and ambitious thresholds, and gives exact computation guidance (scripts/pseudocode). Use these metrics on the validation set unless noted otherwise.\\n\\nAssumptions\\n- The \"spec\" includes standard metrics: Exact Match (EM), Numeric Tolerance, Denotation Accuracy, Execution Accuracy / Unit-Tests pass rate, pass@k, BLEU/ROUGE for free-form text.\\n- Predictions are provided as a JSONL file with one object per line with at minimum fields: id, prediction (string), and optionally samples (for pass@k).\\n\\n1) Arithmetic / Math\\n- Primary metric: Numeric Exact Match within tolerance (EM_num).\\n  - Conservative threshold: 90% validation EM_num\\n  - Ambitious threshold: 98% validation EM_num\\n- Secondary metric: Average Absolute Error (MAE) or relative error for regression-style tasks.\\n  - Conservative: MAE <= 0.02 * |mean_gold|\\n  - Ambitious: MAE <= 0.005 * |mean_gold|\\n\\nHow to compute:\\n- For each example:\\n  - If gold has numeric_tolerance: use that.\\n  - Else default: absolute tolerance = 1e-6 for integers, or relative=1e-6 for floats.\\n- EM_num = fraction of examples where |pred - gold| <= max(absolute_tolerance, relative_tolerance * |gold|)\\n- MAE = mean(|pred - gold|)\\n\\nPseudocode:\\n- See evaluation_scripts/compute_arithmetic_metrics.py\\n  - parse predictions and gold\\n  - coerce to numeric (handle strings like \"45\", \"45.0\", \"45 +/- 1\")\\n  - evaluate using tolerances\\n\\nCommand (example):\\npython evaluation_scripts/compute_arithmetic_metrics.py \\\\\\n  --pred predictions.jsonl \\\\\\n  --gold samples/validation.jsonl \\\\\\n  --out results_arithmetic.json\\n\\n2) Code generation\\n- Primary metric: Execution Accuracy (unit tests pass rate)\\n  - Conservative (pass rate on unit tests): 40% (pass@1)\\n  - Ambitious: 70% (pass@1)\\n- Secondary metric: pass@k (for sampling-based models), where k is typically 5 or 10.\\n  - Conservative pass@5 >= 55%\\n  - Ambitious pass@5 >= 85%\\n- Safety metric: sandbox escape rate = 0\\n\\nHow to compute:\\n- For each problem with N candidate predictions (N≥1):\\n  - If unit tests provided: attempt to run candidate code in sandbox; mark success if all tests pass.\\n  - Execution Accuracy = fraction of problems where at least one candidate passes tests (for pass@k, compute fraction with any pass among k samples).\\n- pass@k formula (for sampled outputs with n independent samples and c successes) — use standard closed-form estimate:\\n  - pass@k = 1 - comb(n-c,k)/comb(n,k)   (for exact formula when sampling w/o replacement)\\n  - If you have only one sample, pass@1 = fraction of single-sample that passes.\\n\\nPseudocode for running tests:\\n- For each example:\\n  - create ephemeral container with required language/runtime\\n  - install dependencies\\n  - run tests with timeout and resource limits (no network)\\n  - capture stdout/stderr and exit code\\n  - mark pass if tests exit with code 0 and expected outputs match\\n\\nCommand (example):\\n# sandbox runner (requires Docker + test harness)\\npython evaluation_scripts/run_code_tests.py \\\\\\n  --pred candidates.jsonl \\\\\\n  --gold samples/validation.jsonl \\\\\\n  --max-workers 8 \\\\\\n  --timeout 30 \\\\\\n  --out results_code.json\\n\\nNotes:\\n- If running code in CI is disallowed, fallback is to run static checks (compilation, simple outputs), or human evaluation.\\n\\n3) Semantic parsing (text -> MR/SQL)\\n- Primary metric: Denotation Accuracy (DA) — run MR against canonical database and compare results\\n  - Conservative threshold: 75% denotation accuracy\\n  - Ambitious threshold: 95% denotation accuracy\\n- Secondary metric: Exact Match (EM) on normalized MR (after canonicalization)\\n  - Conservative: 60%\\n  - Ambitious: 90%\\n\\nHow to compute:\\n- If executor_config / DB snapshot is available:\\n  - Run MR and normalize returned results; comparison is set-equality (order-insensitive) unless domain requires order.\\n- If no executable environment, use normalized string EM on canonical_form (tokenization & canonicalization steps must be specified)\\n\\nCommand (example):\\npython evaluation_scripts/compute_denotation_accuracy.py \\\\\\n  --pred predictions.jsonl \\\\\\n  --gold samples/validation.jsonl \\\\\\n  --db snapshots/mysql_validation.db \\\\\\n  --out results_semparse.json\\n\\n4) Explanation / Chain-of-Thought (CoT) quality rubric\\n- Metric: Human-rated CoT quality 1-5 scale (see rubric below). For aggregate metrics, report average score and % >= 4.\\n\\nCoT rubric (1–5)\\n- 5 (Excellent): Correct final answer; step-by-step reasoning is logically correct, complete, concise, and would allow an expert to verify each step. No hallucinations. Example: clear algebra steps with each transformation explicitly stated and correct.\\n- 4 (Good): Correct final answer; reasoning mostly correct with minor omissions or small inefficiencies, but no incorrect steps that affect final answer.\\n- 3 (Acceptable): Final answer correct but reasoning has several gaps or unclear steps that require filling in; or reasoning mostly correct but contains a minor incorrect inference that doesn\\'t affect final.\\n- 2 (Poor): Final answer possibly correct (or incorrect); reasoning contains major mistakes or unjustified leaps; steps are ambiguous or contradictory.\\n- 1 (Bad): Final answer incorrect and reasoning is wrong, incoherent, or hallucinated.\\n\\nCoT rubric examples (short)\\n- Example (5): \"To solve 2x+3=7: subtract 3 => 2x=4 => x=2.\"\\n- Example (3): \"Solve: 2x+3=7. So x=4/2=2.\" (skips subtraction explicit mention)\\n- Example (1): \"x=7+3/2=5.5\" (incorrect step)\\n\\nCoT scoring instructions for annotators:\\n- Check correctness of each reasoning step.\\n- Check whether any step uses unsupported facts.\\n- Check clarity & sufficiency.\\n\\n5) Aggregation reporting\\n- Provide overall metrics per-task and broken down by difficulty, source, or length buckets (e.g., prompt length).\\n- Provide confusion analysis and sample failures.\\n\\nMachine-readable mapping (JSON)\\n- Provided below as \"evaluation_metrics.json\".\\n\\n---\\n\\nB.

They will also correct or provide canonical answers when asked.\\n\\nGeneral instructions\\n1. Read the prompt and gold/reference carefully.\\n2. For each model response, answer the required fields in the annotation UI:\\n   - final_answer_correct? (Yes/No)\\n   - final_answer_normalized (text)\\n   - reason_steps_quality (1–5)\\n   - notes (free text)\\n   - any safety/PII concerns? (Yes/No + comment)\\n3. Use gold references and test harnesses where available. If a task includes a run/test harness, use it rather than manual inspection to assess correctness.\\n\\nSpecific instructions per task\\n\\nArithmetic tasks\\n- Normalize numerical answers: strip commas, normal scientific notation accepted.\\n- Use numeric tolerances provided in example; if none provided:\\n  - default absolute tolerance = 1e-6 for floats;\\n  - for integer expected_format, enforce exact integer match.\\n- If multiple answers are acceptable, select “Yes” if prediction matches any acceptable answer after normalization.\\n- Edge cases:\\n  - Answers like \"45 (approx.)\" should be considered correct if within tolerance.\\n  - If units are required (e.g., meters), check units; missing unit is incorrect if unit was explicitly required.\\n\\nCode tasks\\n- Attempt to run candidate code in the provided sandbox runner (tests provided).\\n- Mark final_answer_correct only if code passes all unit tests or matches expected outputs for provided inputs.\\n- If unit tests cannot run (external dependencies/network/etc.), annotate as \"Cannot Auto-Evaluate\" and provide manual review notes:\\n  - Does the code compile?\\n  - Are obvious security issues present (e.g., os.system with network/exec)?\\n- For subtle correctness issues (time complexity, edge cases), annotate notes and mark rating accordingly.\\n\\nSemantic parsing\\n- If an executor and DB snapshot exist, prefer denotation check: run MR and compare result set to gold denotation.\\n- If only canonical MR is available, perform canonicalization (strip whitespace, normalized aliases) then exact-match on tokens.\\n- For ambiguous queries, record whether multiple MRs would be acceptable and annotate accordingly.\\n\\nCoT (Chain-of-Thought) rating (1–5)\\n- See rubric in evaluation_rubric.md. Rate reasoning on logical validity, completeness, clarity, and lack of hallucination.\\n- Examples:\\n  - 5: Step-by-step derivation with correct transformations.\\n  - 3: Correct answer but skipped intermediate steps or not sufficient to reproduce work.\\n  - 1: Incorrect logic leading to wrong answer or hallucinated facts.\\n\\nAnnotation UI fields (recommended fields)\\n- example_id (immutable)\\n- annotator_id\\n- timestamp\\n- final_correct (yes/no/cannot_evaluate)\\n- final_answer_normalized (text)\\n- cot_rating (1..5)\\n- cot_comments (text)\\n- eval_notes (text)\\n- privacy_flag (true/false)\\n- reviewer_needed (true/false if disagreement)\\n\\nCorner cases and decision rules\\n- Multiple correct outputs: mark as correct if any predicted output equals any gold reference after normalization; document ambiguous cases.\\n- Non-deterministic problems: If code can produce different but valid outputs, consult gold denotation or mark as manual-review.\\n- Incomplete CoT: if CoT contains correct steps but omits step notation between two heavy leaps, rate 3.\\n- Safety/PII: If prompt or output contains PII, tag privacy_flag and do not copy PII into external tools.\\n\\nInter-annotator agreement and adjudication\\n- Required target: Cohen\\'s kappa >= 0.8 for categorical final_correct, Krippendorff\\'s alpha >= 0.8 for CoT rating aggregation (or equivalent).\\n- Annotation plan:\\n  - Each example will be double-annotated (2 annotators).\\n  - Disagreements on final_correct or cot_rating escalated to a 3rd annotator (adjudicator).\\n  - Adjudicator final decision recorded.\\n\\nAnnotator training and qualification\\n- Provide a one-hour training session with examples and calibration task of 20 sample examples. Expect annotator qualification with >=85% agreement on calibration set.\\n- Provide an annotation manual with examples and quick decision rules (this document).\\n\\nAnnotation throughput and staffing estimate (for 200 validation examples)\\n- Average annotation times (estimates):\\n  - Arithmetic example: 1.5–3.0 minutes\\n  - Semantic parse: 3–6 minutes (denotation or normalization)\\n  - Code (with auto-tests): 4–8 minutes if auto-run works; 8–20 minutes if manual review is needed\\n  - CoT rating: 1–3 minutes\\n\\nStaffing plan (200 examples)\\n- Required annotators: 3 annotators total (to enable double annotation + adjudication):\\n  - Each example annotated twice (2 annotations) -> 400 annotation instances.\\n  - With 3 annotators, distribute ~133 annotation instances per annotator.\\n- Time per annotator estimate (average across tasks ~4 minutes per annotation):\\n  - 133 * 4 min = ~532 minutes ≈ 8.9 hours\\n  - Add 2 hours for training/calibration + 1 hour for review = ~12 hours/annotator\\n- Adjudication:\\n  - Expect ~15–25% disagreements (estimate) -> ~30–50 adjudication cases (3rd annotator time included above as distributed).\\n- Minimum staffing: 3 annotators trained and available; 1 project manager for QC (part-time).\\n\\nAnnotation tool recommendation\\n- Recommended: LabelStudio (open-source, free/community) — supports multi-annotator workflows, double-annotation, custom schemas, export to JSONL/CSV, role-based access.\\n- Alternative: Prodigy (paid) if you prefer active learning and faster interface.\\n- Rationale for LabelStudio:\\n  - Easy to install and host internally\\n  - Supports multiple users, assignments, overlaps for IAA\\n  - Export in JSON or CSV for ingestion\\n\\nLabelStudio configuration notes\\n- Create a project per task (arithmetic, code, semantic parsing).\\n- Define schema matching the required output fields (final_correct, final_answer_normalized, cot_rating, etc.)\\n- Use assignment overlaps (set overlap to 2) to get double annotation per example.\\n- Set up an adjudication workflow for disagreements.\\n\\nPART 4 — Privacy / compliance checklist (for human annotators)\\n\\nPrivacy and compliance checklist\\n- PII handling:\\n  - Prohibit annotators from exporting, downloading, or copying PII outside the annotation environment.\\n  - Redact or hash PII in stored examples where possible (names, emails, phone numbers, SSNs).\\n  - If an example necessitates PII exposure for correctness, log the minimal access and restrict to vetted annotators.\\n- Data minimization:\\n  - Only present necessary fields to annotators.\\n  - Use reduced context or obfuscated PII for training if possible.\\n- Consent and provenance:\\n  - Ensure dataset sources have appropriate licenses and consent for human review.\\n  - Maintain an audit trail: who accessed which sample and when.\\n- Data retention:\\n  - Define retention policy (e.g., annotations stored for X months);

If yes: GPU types (e.g., A100, V100, T4), counts, and driver/CUDA versions.\\n   - CI/runner availability and whether Docker is allowed in your environment.\\n   - S3 or GCS bucket(s) for storing datasets and annotations — full path(s) and write permissions for the annotators or a service account.\\n   - Any existing runner for code execution in evaluation (e.g., a sandboxed runner, container images).\\n3) Repo access:\\n   - Do you want annotated files uploaded to the repo or only to an S3/GCS bucket? Provide target path and write permissions.\\n   - Confirm whether I may push the evaluation scripts and CI changes (if not, I will produce PR-ready patches).\\n4) Annotator availability:\\n   - Please confirm availability of 3 annotators for Week-3 labeling task (names or yes/no). If not available, say how many are available and whether contractors can be engaged.\\n\\nPotential constraints and proposed mitigations\\n- Constraint: No repo access / missing files -> I cannot validate schema or run validator.\\n  - Mitigation: Provide files or grant access, or paste schema here.\\n- Constraint: Running code tests in your environment may be disallowed (security).\\n  - Mitigation: Use a separate isolated evaluation cluster (air-gapped), or use static analysis + manual review for code.\\n- Constraint: PII or legal prohibitions against third-party annotators.\\n  - Mitigation: Use vetted in-house annotators or hire third-party under DPA and limited redacted datasets.\\n- Constraint: No sandbox/container runner to execute code tasks.\\n  - Mitigation: Create Docker images per language or use existing open-source runners; if impossible, rely on unit test heuristics / human evaluation.\\n- Constraint: No DB snapshots for semantic parsing denotation evaluation.\\n  - Mitigation: Build small canonical DB fixtures for evaluation; fallback to normalized EM with clear acceptance criteria.\\n\\nNext steps I will take once you reply with requested access/info\\n1. Inspect schema/schema.json and list exactly which required fields are missing or inconsistent.\\n2. Run schema/validate_samples.py on samples/validation.jsonl and produce validation_report.json with fixes.\\n3. Run evaluation scripts (or adapt them) to compute baseline metrics and produce results_*.json outputs.\\n4. Finalize the evaluation_rubric.md, the JSON/CSV mapping, annotator_guidelines.md, and runbook.md and commit them to the repo / send them to you.\\n\\nIf you want, I can immediately produce the evaluation scripts skeletons referenced in the rubric (python files) and tests for the validator — these are ready to be adapted to the repo; tell me whether you want them included in the first deliverable.\\n\\nWould you please:\\n- Grant repo access or paste the schema/validator/samples here, and\\n- Provide compute/storage details and confirm whether 3 annotators are available for Week-3?\\n\\nOnce I have those, I will complete items (1)–(5) and push the files named:\\n- evaluation_rubric.md\\n- evaluation_metrics.json and evaluation_metrics.csv\\n- annotator_guidelines.md\\n- runbook.md\\n\\nIf any part of the above should be adjusted to match an internal spec I don’t yet have (different metric names or thresholds), please paste that spec or indicate changes.'}], 'author_name': 'VerifierAgent', 'additional_properties': {}}\n",

If you permit offshore contractors, rates are lower (e.g., $8–$20/hr). Provide your compliance/privacy docs if sensitive data is involved (PII restrictions, NDAs).\\nIf third-party annotators are not permitted, we will need your internal annotators or a vendor approved by your compliance team.\\n\\n6) Run schema/validate_samples.py on samples/validation.jsonl\\nCurrent status:\\n- I do not have your repo files in this environment, so I could not run validate_samples.py here.\\n- If you provide the repo zip at a download URL or give me S3/GCS read access, I will:\\n  - Extract the repo,\\n  - Run schema/validate_samples.py on samples/validation.jsonl (or create validation.jsonl by concatenating canonical validation splits if missing),\\n  - Produce validation_report.json and upload it to the provided storage path.\\nWhat I will upload (if you provide credentials):\\n- <prefix>/validation_report.json\\n- <prefix>/samples/validation.jsonl (if I created one)\\nExact command I will run (or you can run locally):\\n- (from the repo root)\\n  python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\\n  python3 schema/validate_samples.py samples/validation.jsonl --output validation_report.json\\nIf you prefer an automated uploader, I can run a script that uses boto3 or google-cloud-storage to place outputs in your bucket; please provide credentials or a presigned PUT URL.\\n\\n7) Quick baseline inference on 50 examples (flan-t5-small)\\nI cannot run the baseline here because:\\n- This environment has no internet access to download models, and I do not have cached model files available.\\nWhat I can do right now:\\n- Provide a ready-to-run script that will perform zero-shot or few-shot inference on 50 examples using transformers, and upload outputs (predictions.jsonl and results_arithmetic.json) to S3/GCS.\\n- If you provide a machine/runner with internet or provide the model files (a local Hugging Face model directory), I will run it and upload results.\\nRunnable inference script (save as run_baseline.py).

I will run each generated function against the provided test cases and produce pass/fail per example.

I can prepare that within 24 hours.\\n\\n2) Storage path and credentials for outputs\\n- Status: I cannot create or supply production credentials from this environment.\\n- What I need from you (pick one):\\n  - Option A — S3 temporary credentials (preferred):\\n    - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, optional AWS_SESSION_TOKEN, bucket name and prefix (e.g., my-bucket/ingestion/).\\n    - Minimal IAM policy (scoped to prefix) you can attach to the user:\\n      {\\n        \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\\n        \"Statement\": [\\n          {\\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\\n            \"Action\": [\"s3:PutObject\",\"s3:GetObject\"],\\n            \"Resource\": [\"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/ingestion/*\"]\\n          },\\n          {\\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\\n            \"Action\": [\"s3:ListBucket\"],\\n            \"Resource\": [\"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket\"],\\n            \"Condition\": {\"StringLike\": {\"s3:prefix\": [\"ingestion/*\"]}}\\n          }\\n        ]\\n      }\\n  - Option B — GCS service account key:\\n    - JSON key for a service account that has roles/storage.objectViewer and roles/storage.objectCreator on the target bucket.\\n  - Option C — Presigned PUT URLs:\\n    - Create presigned PUT URLs for the files I will upload:\\n      - validation_report.json\\n      - predictions.jsonl\\n      - results_arithmetic.json (or results_*.json)\\n    - I will PUT to these URLs (no creds needed).\\n- Alternative / fallback:\\n  - If you prefer not to share credentials at all, you run the upload from your side. I will supply the files and instructions.\\n\\n3) Compute details I need from you\\n- I cannot inspect your infra from here. Please provide the exact compute resources you will allocate so I can plan which baselines to run. Tell me:\\n  - GPU model(s) and counts (e.g., 1x NVIDIA T4, 2x A10, 4x A100-80GB).\\n  - Per-GPU memory (e.g., T4: 16GB, A100: 40GB/80GB).\\n  - vCPU and RAM per machine (e.g., 16 vCPU / 64 GB RAM).\\n  - Disk space available (GB).\\n  - CUDA / driver versions (if available).\\n  - Whether preemptible/spot instances are acceptable.\\n  - Monthly budget constraint (approx $ / month) if you want me to constrain experiments.\\n- Recommended minimal configurations (for you to select):\\n  - For quick baseline (flan-t5-small; 50 examples): CPU-only (8 vCPU, 32 GB RAM) is OK; GPU (T4/A10 with 16–24 GB) recommended to speed up.\\n  - For code models / 350M–2B: single GPU with 16–24 GB VRAM (T4/A10/V100) OR quantized 7B on 24GB with bitsandbytes techniques.\\n  - For larger evaluation / finetuning: A100-40GB (or A100-80GB cluster).\\n- My plan depending on what you provide:\\n  - If you give me a GPU-enabled VM (SSH or CI runner) and storage creds, I will run baseline inference and code-execution tests in a sandboxed Docker container.\\n\\n4) Docker & CI runners; permission to execute sandboxed code\\n- I need explicit confirmation whether you allow:\\n  - Docker image builds and container execution in your environment or CI runners.\\n  - Automated sandboxed execution of model-generated code (required to run HumanEval / MBPP unit tests). This must be on a machine you approve because it executes untrusted code.\\n- If you approve, I will:\\n  - Provide a Dockerfile that sets up a minimal runtime with python, torch, transformers, jsonschema, boto3/gsutil, and a small entrypoint to run ingestion/validation/baseline steps.\\n  - Provide a GitHub Actions workflow or equivalent to run ingestion and validation and upload artifacts.\\n- If you do not approve automated execution of code, I will run only non-executable checks (schema validation, tokenization) and deliver predictions; you (or an approved runner) will need to run the code tests.\\n\\n5) Run schema/validate_samples.py on samples/validation.jsonl\\n- I can do this and upload validation_report.json as soon as you provide either:\\n  - Readable repo zip (presigned GET) plus a presigned PUT URL or storage creds for uploading result, OR\\n  - Direct credentials (S3/GCS) so I can upload.\\n- If you prefer to run it yourself, run locally with these exact commands:\\n  - Install deps (in a venv): python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\\n  - Run validation:\\n    python3 schema/validate_samples.py samples/validation.jsonl --output validation_report.json\\n  - Upload to S3:\\n    aws s3 cp validation_report.json s3://your-bucket/ingestion/validation_report.json\\n  - Upload to GCS:\\n    gsutil cp validation_report.json gs://your-bucket/ingestion/validation_report.json\\n- Timeline if you provide creds:\\n  - I will run validation and upload validation_report.json within 24 hours of receiving credentials/presigned URLs.\\n\\n6) Quick baseline inference (50 examples) using flan-t5-small\\n- I cannot download models or run inference in this environment (no internet / model cache). I will run it for you if you provide:\\n  - A machine (SSH/CI runner) with internet and GPU (or CPU) access and the storage creds/presigned PUT URLs.\\n  - OR a local copy of the model directory (Hugging Face style) uploaded to your storage and read access granted.\\n- If you provide access, I will:\\n  - Run zero-shot generation on 50 examples from samples/validation.jsonl using google/flan-t5-small (or another specified small model).\\n  - Produce predictions.jsonl (one JSON object per line: {id, input, prediction, metadata}) and a small results file results_arithmetic.json containing per-example pass/fail and summary accuracy for arithmetic tasks.\\n  - Upload predictions.jsonl and results_arithmetic.json to the storage prefix you provide.\\n- Timeline if you provide compute & storage:\\n  - I will run and upload baseline outputs within 48 hours.\\n- If you do not provide compute, I will deliver a fully-tested run_baseline.py script and a Dockerfile so your verifier can run it. The commands will be exact and reproducible.\\n\\n7) Annotator availability and privacy/compliance\\n- I do not have in-house annotators to assign to your Week-3 labeling task.\\n- Please confirm whether third-party annotators / vendors are allowed. Suggested options:\\n  - Use an approved vendor you already contract with (Scale AI, Appen, Labelbox) — I can prepare the labeling spec and upload job manifests.\\n  - If you want me to coordinate a vendor, provide procurement/compliance approval. Vendor onboarding usually takes 3–7 business days for small projects.\\n- Privacy/compliance: tell me:\\n  - Are there PII restrictions? (Yes/No)\\n  - Do annotators need to sign NDAs / DPAs? (Yes/No)\\n  - Any dataset-specific rules (no data leaving premises, no offshore annotators, HIPAA/PCI requirements)?\\n- Estimates:\\n  - 3 annotators for 1 week (part-time) should be available if you arrange vendor or internal staff. Cost ranges widely; typical contractor rates $8–40/hr depending on region and skill.\\n- If third-party annotators are not allowed, timeline extension: please provide internal annotators and their availability. I will provide annotation UI templates and manifest files.\\n\\nIf any item cannot be provided, here are explicit statements + mitigations\\n- I cannot create or provide repo credentials, S3/GCS creds, or upload files from this environment. Mitigation:\\n  - Provide presigned PUT URLs or temporary credentials OR I will deliver runnable artifacts that you run locally/CI.\\n- I cannot run the validation or baseline without either (A) the repo zip with the samples and code, or (B) access to your repo/runner with network to download models. Mitigation:\\n  - Provide the repo zip or runner; otherwise run the commands I supply locally.\\n- I do not have annotators. Mitigation:\\n  - I will prepare the labeling spec, task instructions, and data manifests so an internal or vendor team can onboard quickly.\\n\\nExact commands & small scripts you can run right now (copy/paste)\\n- Validate samples locally (one-liner):\\n  python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt && python3 schema/validate_samples.py samples/validation.jsonl --output validation_report.json\\n- Upload to S3:\\n  aws s3 cp validation_report.json s3://your-bucket/ingestion/validation_report.json\\n- Run a 50-example baseline locally (example script saved as run_baseline.py; you can run after installing deps):\\n  python3 run_baseline.py --model google/flan-t5-small --input samples/validation.jsonl --out_pred predictions.jsonl --max_examples 50 --device cpu\\n- Minimal run_baseline.py (I will add to repo or paste into a file for you):\\n  - Loads model via Hugging Face transformers, generates output, writes predictions.jsonl.\\n\\nSecurity note about executing model-generated code\\n- Running generated code (HumanEval/MBPP) requires a sandbox (Docker container with resource limits) or a secure VM. Please confirm you approve sandboxed execution on an approved runner (I will provide a Docker container to isolate execution). If you do not permit this, I will only generate predictions and provide unit-test harnesses for you to run.\\n\\nProposed timeline once you provide required artifacts/permissions\\n- If you provide presigned GET for repo zip + presigned PUTs or credentials now:\\n  - Within 24 hours: run schema validation and upload validation_report.json.\\n  - Within 48 hours: run baseline inference (50 examples) and upload predictions.jsonl and results_arithmetic.json.\\n- If you cannot provide creds:\\n  - Within 24 hours: I will produce the final repo zip (scripts, Dockerfile, GH Actions YAML) and attach it here for your verifier to run. You will run the validation/baseline on your side with the provided exact commands.\\n\\nNext steps / what I need from you right now (choose one)\\n1) Provide a presigned GET URL to the repo zip and presigned PUT URLs for these files:\\n   - validation_report.json\\n   - predictions.jsonl\\n   - results_arithmetic.json (or results_*.json)\\n   If you supply these, I will execute and upload results within 48 hours.\\nOR\\n2) Provide temporary S3 credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID / AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY / bucket/prefix) or a GCS service account key; I will run and upload within 24–48 hours.\\nOR\\n3) If credentials are not allowed, ask me to upload a new repo zip (with Dockerfile and CI) here in the chat within 24 hours that your verifier can run; I will produce that immediately.\\n\\nIf you tell me which option you prefer I will proceed immediately and report back with precise confirmation and expected upload URLs/timestamps.'}], 'author_name': 'CoderAgent', 'additional_properties': {}}\n",

If you permit offshore contractors, rates are lower (e.g., $8–$20/hr). Provide your compliance/privacy docs if sensitive data is involved (PII restrictions, NDAs).\\nIf third-party annotators are not permitted, we will need your internal annotators or a vendor approved by your compliance team.\\n\\n6) Run schema/validate_samples.py on samples/validation.jsonl\\nCurrent status:\\n- I do not have your repo files in this environment, so I could not run validate_samples.py here.\\n- If you provide the repo zip at a download URL or give me S3/GCS read access, I will:\\n  - Extract the repo,\\n  - Run schema/validate_samples.py on samples/validation.jsonl (or create validation.jsonl by concatenating canonical validation splits if missing),\\n  - Produce validation_report.json and upload it to the provided storage path.\\nWhat I will upload (if you provide credentials):\\n- <prefix>/validation_report.json\\n- <prefix>/samples/validation.jsonl (if I created one)\\nExact command I will run (or you can run locally):\\n- (from the repo root)\\n  python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\\n  python3 schema/validate_samples.py samples/validation.jsonl --output validation_report.json\\nIf you prefer an automated uploader, I can run a script that uses boto3 or google-cloud-storage to place outputs in your bucket; please provide credentials or a presigned PUT URL.\\n\\n7) Quick baseline inference on 50 examples (flan-t5-small)\\nI cannot run the baseline here because:\\n- This environment has no internet access to download models, and I do not have cached model files available.\\nWhat I can do right now:\\n- Provide a ready-to-run script that will perform zero-shot or few-shot inference on 50 examples using transformers, and upload outputs (predictions.jsonl and results_arithmetic.json) to S3/GCS.\\n- If you provide a machine/runner with internet or provide the model files (a local Hugging Face model directory), I will run it and upload results.\\nRunnable inference script (save as run_baseline.py).

For 50 examples, CPU run is a few minutes.\\n- If device=\"cuda\" set to GPU and you have CUDA drivers that match your PyTorch build.\\n\\nHow I will compute metrics for arithmetic & code:\\n- Arithmetic: parse final_answer from model output if present; otherwise apply problem-specific checker (for GSM8K use rationales + final answer extraction).\\n- Code: for HumanEval/MBPP, use the dataset-provided unit tests or simple exec-run harness. I will run each generated function against the provided test cases and produce pass/fail per example. This requires a secure sandbox (Docker runner) or a safe environment to execute untrusted code.\\n\\nSecurity note about executing model-generated code\\n- Executing arbitrary model-generated code requires sandboxing. If you permit me to run code execution on your provided VM or CI runner, please confirm that a Docker runner or isolated environment is approved. Otherwise I will only produce predictions and the tests as artifacts for you to run in your environment.\\n\\nDeliverables I will produce once you provide access (timeline)\\n- Within 24 hours after you provide repo zip or repo push access:\\n  - Extract and run schema/validate_samples.py on samples/validation.jsonl (or create validation.jsonl by concatenating splits), produce validation_report.json and upload to your S3/GCS location.\\n  - If requested, open a PR (or push) with Dockerfile and GitHub Actions workflows for ingestion & validation.\\n- Within 48 hours after you provide storage creds and compute (or model files):\\n  - Run baseline inference on 50 examples using flan-t5-small and upload predictions.jsonl and results_arithmetic.json (metrics summary).\\n- If any of the above are blocked by missing access, I will provide a ready-to-run command set and helper scripts (upload / s3/gcs uploader) and can assist your engineer to run them.\\n\\nExact information I need from you now to proceed within 3 business days\\n1) Choose one repo access method (A or B above) and provide the artifact (signed URL, upload, or repo invite).\\n2) Provide S3/GCS credentials (temporary preferred) or presigned PUT URLs for:\\n   - <prefix>/validation_report.json\\n   - <prefix>/predictions.jsonl\\n   - <prefix>/results_arithmetic.json\\n3) Tell me which compute option you will provide (or say you want me to run in your cloud) and whether preemptible instances are allowed.\\n4) Confirm whether I am allowed to run Docker containers and execute generated code in your environment (sandbox requirement).\\n5) Confirm annotator policy (do you have 3 annotators or do you want me to recommend vendors and manage the vendor onboarding?).\\n6) If you prefer I run validation/baseline, grant a short-lived credential set or provide the download URL for the repo zip now.\\n\\nIf you want me to proceed immediately and run validation here\\n- Provide a direct download URL to the repo zip (HTTP(S) link) or upload the zip to /mnt/data via the shared storage you control (or give me an S3 presigned GET URL).\\nOnce I receive the zip, I will:\\n- Extract repo,\\n- Run validate_samples.py on samples/validation.jsonl and write validation_report.json,\\n- Upload report to your storage (if you provided credentials) or supply it here for download.\\n\\nUseful helper snippets (you can paste into your shell)\\n\\nA) Validate locally (one-liner)\\npython3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt && python3 schema/validate_samples.py samples/validation.jsonl --output validation_report.json\\n\\nB) Upload validation_report.json to S3 (bash; using AWS CLI)\\naws s3 cp validation_report.json s3://your-bucket/ingestion/validation_report.json\\n\\nC) Upload to GCS (bash; using gsutil)\\ngsutil cp validation_report.json gs://your-bucket/ingestion/validation_report.json\\n\\nD) Minimal IAM policy for S3 (create a scoped user; replace your-bucket)\\n{\\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\\n  \"Statement\": [\\n    {\\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\\n      \"Action\": [\"s3:PutObject\",\"s3:GetObject\"],\\n      \"Resource\": [\"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/ingestion/*\"]\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\nNext steps — please pick one\\n- Option 1 (fastest): Provide a presigned GET URL to the repo zip and an S3 presigned PUT URL or temporary credentials.

Suggested options:\\n  - Use an approved vendor you already contract with (Scale AI, Appen, Labelbox) — I can prepare the labeling spec and upload job manifests.\\n  - If you want me to coordinate a vendor, provide procurement/compliance approval. Vendor onboarding usually takes 3–7 business days for small projects.\\n- Privacy/compliance: tell me:\\n  - Are there PII restrictions? (Yes/No)\\n  - Do annotators need to sign NDAs / DPAs? (Yes/No)\\n  - Any dataset-specific rules (no data leaving premises, no offshore annotators, HIPAA/PCI requirements)?\\n- Estimates:\\n  - 3 annotators for 1 week (part-time) should be available if you arrange vendor or internal staff. Cost ranges widely; typical contractor rates $8–40/hr depending on region and skill.\\n- If third-party annotators are not allowed, timeline extension: please provide internal annotators and their availability. I will provide annotation UI templates and manifest files.\\n\\nIf any item cannot be provided, here are explicit statements + mitigations\\n- I cannot create or provide repo credentials, S3/GCS creds, or upload files from this environment. Mitigation:\\n  - Provide presigned PUT URLs or temporary credentials OR I will deliver runnable artifacts that you run locally/CI.\\n- I cannot run the validation or baseline without either (A) the repo zip with the samples and code, or (B) access to your repo/runner with network to download models. Mitigation:\\n  - Provide the repo zip or runner; otherwise run the commands I supply locally.\\n- I do not have annotators. Mitigation:\\n  - I will prepare the labeling spec, task instructions, and data manifests so an internal or vendor team can onboard quickly.\\n\\nExact commands & small scripts you can run right now (copy/paste)\\n- Validate samples locally (one-liner):\\n  python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt && python3 schema/validate_samples.py samples/validation.jsonl --output validation_report.json\\n- Upload to S3:\\n  aws s3 cp validation_report.json s3://your-bucket/ingestion/validation_report.json\\n- Run a 50-example baseline locally (example script saved as run_baseline.py; you can run after installing deps):\\n  python3 run_baseline.py --model google/flan-t5-small --input samples/validation.jsonl --out_pred predictions.jsonl --max_examples 50 --device cpu\\n- Minimal run_baseline.py (I will add to repo or paste into a file for you):\\n  - Loads model via Hugging Face transformers, generates output, writes predictions.jsonl.\\n\\nSecurity note about executing model-generated code\\n- Running generated code (HumanEval/MBPP) requires a sandbox (Docker container with resource limits) or a secure VM. Please confirm you approve sandboxed execution on an approved runner (I will provide a Docker container to isolate execution). If you do not permit this, I will only generate predictions and provide unit-test harnesses for you to run.\\n\\nProposed timeline once you provide required artifacts/permissions\\n- If you provide presigned GET for repo zip + presigned PUTs or credentials now:\\n  - Within 24 hours: run schema validation and upload validation_report.json.\\n  - Within 48 hours: run baseline inference (50 examples) and upload predictions.jsonl and results_arithmetic.json.\\n- If you cannot provide creds:\\n  - Within 24 hours: I will produce the final repo zip (scripts, Dockerfile, GH Actions YAML) and attach it here for your verifier to run. You will run the validation/baseline on your side with the provided exact commands.\\n\\nNext steps / what I need from you right now (choose one)\\n1) Provide a presigned GET URL to the repo zip and presigned PUT URLs for these files:\\n   - validation_report.json\\n   - predictions.jsonl\\n   - results_arithmetic.json (or results_*.json)\\n   If you supply these, I will execute and upload results within 48 hours.\\nOR\\n2) Provide temporary S3 credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID / AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY / bucket/prefix) or a GCS service account key; I will run and upload within 24–48 hours.\\nOR\\n3) If credentials are not allowed, ask me to upload a new repo zip (with Dockerfile and CI) here in the chat within 24 hours that your verifier can run; I will produce that immediately.\\n\\nIf you tell me which option you prefer I will proceed immediately and report back with precise confirmation and expected upload URLs/timestamps.'}], 'author_name': 'CoderAgent', 'additional_properties': {}}\n",

For 50 examples, CPU run is a few minutes.\\n- If device=\"cuda\" set to GPU and you have CUDA drivers that match your PyTorch build.\\n\\nHow I will compute metrics for arithmetic & code:\\n- Arithmetic: parse final_answer from model output if present; otherwise apply problem-specific checker (for GSM8K use rationales + final answer extraction).\\n- Code: for HumanEval/MBPP, use the dataset-provided unit tests or simple exec-run harness. I will run each generated function against the provided test cases and produce pass/fail per example. This requires a secure sandbox (Docker runner) or a safe environment to execute untrusted code.\\n\\nSecurity note about executing model-generated code\\n- Executing arbitrary model-generated code requires sandboxing. If you permit me to run code execution on your provided VM or CI runner, please confirm that a Docker runner or isolated environment is approved. Otherwise I will only produce predictions and the tests as artifacts for you to run in your environment.\\n\\nDeliverables I will produce once you provide access (timeline)\\n- Within 24 hours after you provide repo zip or repo push access:\\n  - Extract and run schema/validate_samples.py on samples/validation.jsonl (or create validation.jsonl by concatenating splits), produce validation_report.json and upload to your S3/GCS location.\\n  - If requested, open a PR (or push) with Dockerfile and GitHub Actions workflows for ingestion & validation.\\n- Within 48 hours after you provide storage creds and compute (or model files):\\n  - Run baseline inference on 50 examples using flan-t5-small and upload predictions.jsonl and results_arithmetic.json (metrics summary).\\n- If any of the above are blocked by missing access, I will provide a ready-to-run command set and helper scripts (upload / s3/gcs uploader) and can assist your engineer to run them.\\n\\nExact information I need from you now to proceed within 3 business days\\n1) Choose one repo access method (A or B above) and provide the artifact (signed URL, upload, or repo invite).\\n2) Provide S3/GCS credentials (temporary preferred) or presigned PUT URLs for:\\n   - <prefix>/validation_report.json\\n   - <prefix>/predictions.jsonl\\n   - <prefix>/results_arithmetic.json\\n3) Tell me which compute option you will provide (or say you want me to run in your cloud) and whether preemptible instances are allowed.\\n4) Confirm whether I am allowed to run Docker containers and execute generated code in your environment (sandbox requirement).\\n5) Confirm annotator policy (do you have 3 annotators or do you want me to recommend vendors and manage the vendor onboarding?).\\n6) If you prefer I run validation/baseline, grant a short-lived credential set or provide the download URL for the repo zip now.\\n\\nIf you want me to proceed immediately and run validation here\\n- Provide a direct download URL to the repo zip (HTTP(S) link) or upload the zip to /mnt/data via the shared storage you control (or give me an S3 presigned GET URL).\\nOnce I receive the zip, I will:\\n- Extract repo,\\n- Run validate_samples.py on samples/validation.jsonl and write validation_report.json,\\n- Upload report to your storage (if you provided credentials) or supply it here for download.\\n\\nUseful helper snippets (you can paste into your shell)\\n\\nA) Validate locally (one-liner)\\npython3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt && python3 schema/validate_samples.py samples/validation.jsonl --output validation_report.json\\n\\nB) Upload validation_report.json to S3 (bash; using AWS CLI)\\naws s3 cp validation_report.json s3://your-bucket/ingestion/validation_report.json\\n\\nC) Upload to GCS (bash; using gsutil)\\ngsutil cp validation_report.json gs://your-bucket/ingestion/validation_report.json\\n\\nD) Minimal IAM policy for S3 (create a scoped user; replace your-bucket)\\n{\\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\\n  \"Statement\": [\\n    {\\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\\n      \"Action\": [\"s3:PutObject\",\"s3:GetObject\"],\\n      \"Resource\": [\"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/ingestion/*\"]\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\nNext steps — please pick one\\n- Option 1 (fastest): Provide a presigned GET URL to the repo zip and an S3 presigned PUT URL or temporary credentials.

I will supply the files and instructions.\\n\\n3) Compute details I need from you\\n- I cannot inspect your infra from here. Please provide the exact compute resources you will allocate so I can plan which baselines to run. Tell me:\\n  - GPU model(s) and counts (e.g., 1x NVIDIA T4, 2x A10, 4x A100-80GB).\\n  - Per-GPU memory (e.g., T4: 16GB, A100: 40GB/80GB).\\n  - vCPU and RAM per machine (e.g., 16 vCPU / 64 GB RAM).\\n  - Disk space available (GB).\\n  - CUDA / driver versions (if available).\\n  - Whether preemptible/spot instances are acceptable.\\n  - Monthly budget constraint (approx $ / month) if you want me to constrain experiments.\\n- Recommended minimal configurations (for you to select):\\n  - For quick baseline (flan-t5-small; 50 examples): CPU-only (8 vCPU, 32 GB RAM) is OK; GPU (T4/A10 with 16–24 GB) recommended to speed up.\\n  - For code models / 350M–2B: single GPU with 16–24 GB VRAM (T4/A10/V100) OR quantized 7B on 24GB with bitsandbytes techniques.\\n  - For larger evaluation / finetuning: A100-40GB (or A100-80GB cluster).\\n- My plan depending on what you provide:\\n  - If you give me a GPU-enabled VM (SSH or CI runner) and storage creds, I will run baseline inference and code-execution tests in a sandboxed Docker container.\\n\\n4) Docker & CI runners; permission to execute sandboxed code\\n- I need explicit confirmation whether you allow:\\n  - Docker image builds and container execution in your environment or CI runners.\\n  - Automated sandboxed execution of model-generated code (required to run HumanEval / MBPP unit tests). This must be on a machine you approve because it executes untrusted code.\\n- If you approve, I will:\\n  - Provide a Dockerfile that sets up a minimal runtime with python, torch, transformers, jsonschema, boto3/gsutil, and a small entrypoint to run ingestion/validation/baseline steps.\\n  - Provide a GitHub Actions workflow or equivalent to run ingestion and validation and upload artifacts.\\n- If you do not approve automated execution of code, I will run only non-executable checks (schema validation, tokenization) and deliver predictions; you (or an approved runner) will need to run the code tests.\\n\\n5) Run schema/validate_samples.py on samples/validation.jsonl\\n- I can do this and upload validation_report.json as soon as you provide either:\\n  - Readable repo zip (presigned GET) plus a presigned PUT URL or storage creds for uploading result, OR\\n  - Direct credentials (S3/GCS) so I can upload.\\n- If you prefer to run it yourself, run locally with these exact commands:\\n  - Install deps (in a venv): python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\\n  - Run validation:\\n    python3 schema/validate_samples.py samples/validation.jsonl --output validation_report.json\\n  - Upload to S3:\\n    aws s3 cp validation_report.json s3://your-bucket/ingestion/validation_report.json\\n  - Upload to GCS:\\n    gsutil cp validation_report.json gs://your-bucket/ingestion/validation_report.json\\n- Timeline if you provide creds:\\n  - I will run validation and upload validation_report.json within 24 hours of receiving credentials/presigned URLs.\\n\\n6) Quick baseline inference (50 examples) using flan-t5-small\\n- I cannot download models or run inference in this environment (no internet / model cache). I will run it for you if you provide:\\n  - A machine (SSH/CI runner) with internet and GPU (or CPU) access and the storage creds/presigned PUT URLs.\\n  - OR a local copy of the model directory (Hugging Face style) uploaded to your storage and read access granted.\\n- If you provide access, I will:\\n  - Run zero-shot generation on 50 examples from samples/validation.jsonl using google/flan-t5-small (or another specified small model).\\n  - Produce predictions.jsonl (one JSON object per line: {id, input, prediction, metadata}) and a small results file results_arithmetic.json containing per-example pass/fail and summary accuracy for arithmetic tasks.\\n  - Upload predictions.jsonl and results_arithmetic.json to the storage prefix you provide.\\n- Timeline if you provide compute & storage:\\n  - I will run and upload baseline outputs within 48 hours.\\n- If you do not provide compute, I will deliver a fully-tested run_baseline.py script and a Dockerfile so your verifier can run it. The commands will be exact and reproducible.\\n\\n7) Annotator availability and privacy/compliance\\n- I do not have in-house annotators to assign to your Week-3 labeling task.\\n- Please confirm whether third-party annotators / vendors are allowed. Suggested options:\\n  - Use an approved vendor you already contract with (Scale AI, Appen, Labelbox) — I can prepare the labeling spec and upload job manifests.\\n  - If you want me to coordinate a vendor, provide procurement/compliance approval. Vendor onboarding usually takes 3–7 business days for small projects.\\n- Privacy/compliance: tell me:\\n  - Are there PII restrictions? (Yes/No)\\n  - Do annotators need to sign NDAs / DPAs? (Yes/No)\\n  - Any dataset-specific rules (no data leaving premises, no offshore annotators, HIPAA/PCI requirements)?\\n- Estimates:\\n  - 3 annotators for 1 week (part-time) should be available if you arrange vendor or internal staff. Cost ranges widely; typical contractor rates $8–40/hr depending on region and skill.\\n- If third-party annotators are not allowed, timeline extension: please provide internal annotators and their availability. I will provide annotation UI templates and manifest files.\\n\\nIf any item cannot be provided, here are explicit statements + mitigations\\n- I cannot create or provide repo credentials, S3/GCS creds, or upload files from this environment. Mitigation:\\n  - Provide presigned PUT URLs or temporary credentials OR I will deliver runnable artifacts that you run locally/CI.\\n- I cannot run the validation or baseline without either (A) the repo zip with the samples and code, or (B) access to your repo/runner with network to download models. Mitigation:\\n  - Provide the repo zip or runner; otherwise run the commands I supply locally.\\n- I do not have annotators. Mitigation:\\n  - I will prepare the labeling spec, task instructions, and data manifests so an internal or vendor team can onboard quickly.\\n\\nExact commands & small scripts you can run right now (copy/paste)\\n- Validate samples locally (one-liner):\\n  python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt && python3 schema/validate_samples.py samples/validation.jsonl --output validation_report.json\\n- Upload to S3:\\n  aws s3 cp validation_report.json s3://your-bucket/ingestion/validation_report.json\\n- Run a 50-example baseline locally (example script saved as run_baseline.py; you can run after installing deps):\\n  python3 run_baseline.py --model google/flan-t5-small --input samples/validation.jsonl --out_pred predictions.jsonl --max_examples 50 --device cpu\\n- Minimal run_baseline.py (I will add to repo or paste into a file for you):\\n  - Loads model via Hugging Face transformers, generates output, writes predictions.jsonl.\\n\\nSecurity note about executing model-generated code\\n- Running generated code (HumanEval/MBPP) requires a sandbox (Docker container with resource limits) or a secure VM. Please confirm you approve sandboxed execution on an approved runner (I will provide a Docker container to isolate execution). If you do not permit this, I will only generate predictions and provide unit-test harnesses for you to run.\\n\\nProposed timeline once you provide required artifacts/permissions\\n- If you provide presigned GET for repo zip + presigned PUTs or credentials now:\\n  - Within 24 hours: run schema validation and upload validation_report.json.\\n  - Within 48 hours: run baseline inference (50 examples) and upload predictions.jsonl and results_arithmetic.json.\\n- If you cannot provide creds:\\n  - Within 24 hours: I will produce the final repo zip (scripts, Dockerfile, GH Actions YAML) and attach it here for your verifier to run. You will run the validation/baseline on your side with the provided exact commands.\\n\\nNext steps / what I need from you right now (choose one)\\n1) Provide a presigned GET URL to the repo zip and presigned PUT URLs for these files:\\n   - validation_report.json\\n   - predictions.jsonl\\n   - results_arithmetic.json (or results_*.json)\\n   If you supply these, I will execute and upload results within 48 hours.\\nOR\\n2) Provide temporary S3 credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID / AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY / bucket/prefix) or a GCS service account key; I will run and upload within 24–48 hours.\\nOR\\n3) If credentials are not allowed, ask me to upload a new repo zip (with Dockerfile and CI) here in the chat within 24 hours that your verifier can run; I will produce that immediately.\\n\\nIf you tell me which option you prefer I will proceed immediately and report back with precise confirmation and expected upload URLs/timestamps.'}], 'author_name': 'CoderAgent', 'additional_properties': {}}\n",

I can, however, immediately (A) provide the repo zip for you to download, (B) provide exact scripts, commands, and expected output formats so your verifier or CI can run validation and baseline locally, and (C) run the tasks for you and upload results if you supply either temporary S3/GCS credentials or presigned PUT URLs and a presigned GET for the repo zip (or a runner/VM I can SSH into). If you provide credentials/presigned URLs now I will run validation within 24 hours and the baseline within 48 hours.\\n\\n1) Repo download\\n- I prepared a repo zip previously. If you want me to upload a fresh zip here I will, or you can provide a presigned GET and I will fetch it. If you want me to run validation/baseline, give either:\\n  - a presigned GET URL for the repo zip (so I can download code/samples), OR\\n  - temporary S3/GCS read access to pull the repo, OR\\n  - SSH/CI runner access where I can run the scripts.\\n- If you prefer to run locally, run the commands below in section 3.\\n\\n2) I cannot supply S3/GCS credentials from this environment\\n- What I cannot provide: I cannot create or hand over AWS/GCP credentials or upload files to your buckets from here.\\n- Two safe options you can choose:\\n  - Provide presigned PUT URLs for these specific files (I will PUT to them):\\n    - validation_report.json\\n    - predictions.jsonl\\n    - results_arithmetic.json\\n  - Or provide temporary, scoped credentials (AWS access key / secret / session token or GCS service account JSON) limited to one prefix so I can upload artifacts.

      "  - Code execution tests (HumanEval/MBPP): need a sandboxed Docker runner (2–4 vCPU, 8–16 GB RAM) per parallel worker, plus disk 50–100GB. Execution must be sandboxed.\n",
      "  - Larger evaluations (7B+ models): need 24–80 GB GPU RAM (A10/V100/A100), 32–128 vCPU, 128 GB+ RAM, 200GB+ disk.\n",

      "  - predictions.jsonl\n",
      "  - results_arithmetic.json\n",
      "  -> I will run validation within 24 hours and baseline within 48 hours and upload artifacts.\n",
      "- Option 2: Provide temporary, scoped S3/GCS credentials (or read access to the repo) and confirm a runner where I may execute Docker containers (if you want me to run). Same timeline as Option 1.\n",
      "- Option 3: If you cannot share credentials, I will produce and attach a repo zip (with Dockerfile + GH Actions + scripts) within 24 hours that your verifier can run with the exact commands above. You then run them and upload artifacts (or grant me a presigned PUT for upload).\n",
      "\n",
      "If you choose Option 1 or 2 now, paste the presigned URLs or credentials into a secure channel and I will begin immediately. If you choose Option 3, I will attach the repo zip and the run instructions in my next message (ETA: within 24 hours).\n",

    "### API Key Not Found\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: OpenAI API key not found\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Solution**: Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before running the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Not Available\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: Model 'gpt-5-mini' does not exist\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Solution**: The notebook defaults to `gpt-5-mini` for every role. If this model is unavailable in your account, choose an accessible alternative and update the agent constructors. Common substitutes include:\n",
    "- `gpt-4o` for high-quality reasoning\n",
    "- `gpt-4o-mini` for lower latency and cost\n",
    "- `gpt-4o-reasoning` or other reasoning-tier models if enabled for your workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rate Limits\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: Rate limit exceeded\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Solution**: The workflow makes multiple API calls. If you hit rate limits:\n",
    "- Use lower-tier models (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini` instead of `gpt-5-mini`)\n",
    "- Reduce `max_round_count` to limit conversation length\n",
    "- Add delays between workflow executions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow Stalls or Times Out\n",
    "```\n",
    "Warning: Max stall count reached\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Solution**: The manager detected agents aren't making progress:\n",
    "- Simplify the task\n",
    "- Adjust `max_stall_count` to allow more attempts\n",
    "- Check agent instructions for clarity\n",
    "- Review debug logs to see which agent is stalling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Execution Fails\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: Code execution failed\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Solution**: `HostedCodeInterpreterTool` requires:\n",
    "- OpenAI Responses API or Azure OpenAI with code interpreter enabled\n",
    "- Cannot execute arbitrary local code (runs in OpenAI's sandbox)\n",
    "- Some operations (file I/O, network access) may be restricted"

    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment with this workflow by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modifying agent instructions** - Change role prompts to adjust behavior\n",
    "2. **Adding new agents** - Include specialists like a ResearcherAgent or CriticAgent\n",
    "3. **Trying different tasks** - Test with various complexity levels\n",
    "4. **Adjusting manager parameters** - Tune `max_round_count`, `max_stall_count` for your use case\n",
    "5. **Composing workflows** - Use `.as_agent()` to nest workflows within larger systems\n",
    "6. **Switching models** - Compare performance across different model tiers\n",
