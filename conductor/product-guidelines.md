# Product Guidelines - AgenticFleet

## Tone and Voice

- **Professional and Technical:** Documentation and messages are precise, authoritative, and focused on providing clear information for engineers.
- **Clarity over Fluff:** Avoid marketing jargon; focus on technical accuracy and the functional value of the orchestration system.

## Brand Values

- **Reliability and Production-Readiness:** Emphasize the framework's suitability for mission-critical, large-scale AI operations.
- **Innovation and Intelligence:** Highlight the advanced orchestration patterns and self-optimization capabilities powered by DSPy.
- **Transparency and Observability:** Maintain a clear focus on the 5-phase pipeline and ensure that agent actions are always observable and explainable.

## Documentation and Education

- **Deep Dives with Practical Examples:** Always provide context for complex features (e.g., DSPy compilation, agent shims) alongside actionable code examples.
- **Layered Complexity:** Use a progressive disclosure approach—start with simple "Hello World" scenarios and provide paths to deep-dive architectural details.
- **Technical Accuracy:** Never sacrifice precision for simplicity; use correct terminology to ensure developers have a rigorous understanding of the system.

## Visual Aesthetic

- **Clean and Professional:** A minimalist design that prioritizes high contrast and extreme readability.
- **Focused Utility:** The UI and documentation layout should prioritize the efficient communication of complex data, such as agent telemetry and pipeline status.

## Codebase Evolution & Quality

- **Prioritize Refactoring:** Actively identify and resolve complexity in the existing codebase as a primary objective.
- **High Standards:** Enforce strict type safety (Pydantic), comprehensive testing, and modular design to facilitate long-term maintenance and reduce technical debt.
