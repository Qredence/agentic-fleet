# AgenticFleet Workflows Configuration (Package Default)
# Precedence Order:
#   1. AF_WORKFLOW_CONFIG (absolute path to an alternative YAML)
#   2. This packaged default (workflows.yaml)
#
# Notes:
# - Repo-level override (config/workflows.yaml) removed to prevent drift.
# - Multiple workflows may be defined; only one is typically active per request.
# - Runtime selection is parameter-based (workflow_id) — no env var selector.

      instructions: |
        You are the orchestrator managing a five-agent team: planner, executor, coder,
        verifier, and generator. Coordinate their work strategically to deliver comprehensive
        solutions. Leverage the planner for decomposition, executor for implementation,
        coder for technical tasks, verifier for quality assurance, and generator for synthesis.
