    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MagenticBuilder` creates a workflow with a `StandardMagenticManager` that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reads agent descriptions** to understand each agent's capabilities\n",
    "2. **Creates dynamic plans** based on the task requirements\n",
    "3. **Selects appropriate agents** for each step of the plan\n",
    "4. **Tracks progress** and adapts when agents stall or plans need revision\n",
    "5. **Manages completion** when the task is successfully resolved\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "Each agent uses the same model tier for consistency:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Planner (gpt-5-mini)**: Provides advanced reasoning for decomposing complex tasks\n",
    "- **Executor (gpt-5-mini)**: Handles reasoning-heavy execution steps\n",
    "- **Coder (gpt-5-mini + code interpreter)**: Generates and runs code via the hosted interpreter\n",
    "- **Verifier (gpt-5-mini)**: Validates outputs and ensures quality\n",
    "- **Generator (gpt-5-mini)**: Synthesizes verified outputs into a polished response\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **`reasoning_effort`**: Controls how much computational effort the model uses for reasoning\n",
    "  - `\"low\"`: Faster responses, suitable for simple tasks or synthesis\n",
    "  - `\"medium\"`: Balanced performance (default for most agents)\n",
    "  - `\"high\"`: Maximum reasoning depth for complex analysis, verification, or planning\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`store`**: Boolean flag to enable conversation storage\n",
    "  - `True`: Stores conversations for potential learning and improvement\n",
    "  - `False`: No storage (default)\n",
    "  - Useful for building persistent context across sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`temperature`**: Controls randomness in responses (0.0 - 2.0)\n",
    "  - `0.0-0.3`: Deterministic, focused (ideal for code generation)\n",
    "  - `0.4-0.7`: Balanced creativity and consistency (general tasks)\n",
    "  - `0.8-1.0`: More creative and varied (synthesis, brainstorming)\n",
    "  - `>1.0`: Highly creative but potentially inconsistent\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`max_tokens`**: Maximum length of the response\n",
    "  - Adjust based on expected output length\n",
    "  - Code agents may need more tokens (8192+)\n",
    "  - Simple agents can use fewer (2048-4096)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`top_p`**: Nucleus sampling (0.0 - 1.0)\n",
    "  - Controls diversity via cumulative probability\n",
    "  - Lower values = more focused responses\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`frequency_penalty`**: Reduces repetition (-2.0 to 2.0)\n",
    "  - Positive values discourage repeating the same words\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`presence_penalty`**: Encourages topic diversity (-2.0 to 2.0)\n",

      "INFO:agent_framework:{'type': 'chat_message', 'role': {'type': 'role', 'value': 'assistant'}, 'contents': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Below are (A) a short questionnaire you can send to stakeholders to capture constraints, goals, and concrete examples, followed by (B) a one‑paragraph prioritized MVP definition, and (C) concrete immediate action plans for the coder and for the verifier (with resources and estimated times). Send the questionnaire to the relevant stakeholders, get the answers, then use the action plans to start the project.\\n\\nQUESTIONNAIRE (please answer each item as fully as possible)\\n1) Target problem types and domains\\n- Which problem types should the system handle? (pick any: math word problems, logical puzzles, code generation, commonsense reasoning, table lookup, information extraction, etc.)\\n- For each chosen type, provide 3 representative example inputs and the exact desired outputs (include any preferred output format, e.g., “final numeric answer”, “annotated steps”, “executable code”). For each example state whether intermediate reasoning steps should be returned (e.g., chain‑of‑thought) or hidden.\\n  - Example format to copy for each example:\\n    - Input: \"...\"\\n    - Desired output: \"...\"\\n    - Return reasoning? Yes/No\\n- Priority across types: rank the chosen types 1 (highest)–N.\\n\\n2) Success metrics and targets\\n- Which automatic metrics matter? (examples: exact-match accuracy on benchmark X, token-level BLEU, pass@k for code, F1 for extraction, % correctness)\\n- Quantitative targets for each metric (e.g., “>= 75% exact-match on small dev set”, “latency <= 2s p50”).\\n- Latency and throughput requirements: max acceptable p95 latency, required concurrent throughput (requests/sec), required SLA (% uptime).\\n\\n3) Deployment / operational constraints\\n- Budget for API or infrastructure per month (range is fine).\\n- Privacy/data‑residency constraints (e.g., no PII leave our network, EU data must remain in EU, HIPAA, etc.).\\n- Allowed external APIs/services (yes/no) and any blacklisted integrations.\\n- Availability/constraints on deploying models (cloud only, on‑prem only, must use vendor X).\\n\\n4) Available data and annotation resources\\n- Existing datasets (names, sizes, formats — e.g., CSV of 10k Q/A pairs, repositories of problem statements, logs).\\n- Do you have human-labeled chain‑of‑thought (CoT) or NL→program pairs? If yes, how many and in which format?\\n- Labeling resources: internal annotators or access to crowd workers, available monthly labeling budget, expected time per label.\\n\\n5) Preferred model approach constraints\\n- Preference: closed commercial API (hosted) vs open models self-hosted vs hybrid.\\n- Fine-tuning allowed? (yes/no) If yes, which types (parameter‑efficient tuning, instruction‑tuning, full fine‑tune)?\\n- Compute availability: GPUs (type/quantity), CPUs, memory, and storage available for experiments and for production.\\n- Any cost constraints on model size or requests per second?\\n\\n6) Timeline and priority\\n- Target prototype timeline (e.g., prototype in 2–4 weeks?) and production timeline (e.g., 3 months).\\n- Is rapid demo a higher priority than production robustness? (Yes/No)\\n- Which features must ship in MVP vs can wait for later?\\n\\n7) Safety, interpretability, and regulatory constraints\\n- Explainability requirements (must always show reasoning, or only final answer).\\n- Audit/logging requirements (store prompts/responses, redaction needed, retention period).\\n- Regulatory constraints (GDPR data subject rights, industry-specific rules).\\n- Failure-mode handling: allowed to answer “I don’t know”, must escalate to human, etc.\\n\\nOptional: Additional context\\n- Key stakeholders and reviewers, sample users, and examples of unacceptable outputs.\\n\\nPRIORITIZED MVP (one paragraph)\\nBuild a focused MVP that supports one high‑priority problem type (pick the top‑ranked from your questionnaire) with a narrow input/output schema and deterministic postprocessing. For example, if the priority is math word problems, the MVP will accept plain English problem statements and return a concise numeric answer plus a short structured proof (optional). Target one standard benchmark for comparability (e.g., GSM8K for grade‑school math, HumanEval or MBPP for code generation, a curated 500‑example in‑house dev set for domain tasks). Minimum acceptance criteria: a development set accuracy of at least 60–80% (choose target per task difficulty), p95 inference latency under your stated limit (typical dev target: <2s via API or <500ms for cached/local microservice), and reproducible verification tests (automated checks pass on >=90% of held-out evaluation examples). Keep scope tight: support one input format, one output format, and one model/approach initially (e.g., API-based best-in-class LLM with prompt engineering) and defer fine-tuning or multi-model orchestration to next phase.\\n\\nIMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN — CODER (tasks, required resources, estimated time)\\n1) Data inventory and minimal canonical dataset (1–2 days)\\n- Task: Gather and format 200–500 representative examples across the chosen task into a canonical JSONL with fields {id, input, expected_output, reasoning_allowed:Boolean}.\\n- Resources: developer laptop/VM, text editor, ~2–4 hours of stakeholder interviews to collect examples.\\n- Output: canonical dev set (200–500 examples) and 50 example “hard negatives” if available.\\n\\n2) Quick prompting experiments (2–5 days)\\n- Task: Run iterative prompt‑engineering experiments against the chosen model class (closed API or open local). Start with zero‑shot, few‑shot (3–10 exemplars), CoT vs. answer‑only prompts, and simple output‑formatting instructions.\\n- Sample sizes: 200–500 dev examples; run 3–5 prompt variants (so ~1k–2.5k requests).\\n- Resources: API access or local inference nodes; if using API, reserve $200–$1,000 credits for experiments depending on model and number of runs; laptop/VM for scripting.\\n- Estimated time: 2–3 full workdays for setup and 1–2 days for a round of experiments/analysis.\\n- Output: ranked prompt templates, performance table (accuracy, examples of failures), recommended prompt for MVP.\\n\\n3) Lightweight semantic‑DSL parser prototype (5–10 days)\\n- Task: If outputs must be executable (programs, calculations, or structured logic), implement a small semantic DSL and a parser that maps LLM outputs to the DSL; include a validator and executor. Keep DSL minimal (e.g., arithmetic operators, loops/conditionals if needed, or a small AST for code generation).\\n- Implementation notes: Use Python; implement parser with a simple PEG/regex-based validator or an existing parsing library; include unit tests and sample executions.\\n- Resources: developer workstation, ~1–2 GB storage for code and test data.\\n- Sample sizes: 200 labeled pairs (NL→DSL or NL→program) to validate mapping; can be synthetic for early stages.\\n- Estimated time: 5–10 days for a minimally robust prototype (shorter if DSL is extremely small).\\n\\n4) (Optional) Small fine‑tuning / RCT (2–3 weeks)\\n- Task: If allowed and justified by prompt experiments, run a parameter‑efficient fine‑tune (LoRA or instruction tuning) on ~1k–5k examples.\\n- Compute: single GPU (A10 / T4 / 16‑32GB VRAM) for LoRA-style tuning; larger GPU for full fine-tune.\\n- Estimated time: 1–2 days for setup, 1–7 days for training depending on examples and compute.\\n- Note: Do this only after validating that prompts alone do not meet acceptance criteria.\\n\\nDeliverables for coder by end of prototype: canonical dataset, best prompt(s) and performance table, working DSL parser prototype with tests, and recommendation whether to fine-tune.\\n\\nIMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN — VERIFIER (tasks, required resources, estimated time)\\n1) Define evaluation metrics and automated checks (0.5–1 day)\\n- Task: Translate stakeholder success metrics into concrete tests:\\n  - Correctness: exact‑match, normalized numeric equality, or functional tests (for code: run unit tests).\\n  - Robustness: adversarial paraphrase checks.\\n  - Latency: p50/p95 measured under expected concurrency.\\n  - Safety: banned-phrases/PII redaction checks.\\n- Output: evaluation spec document listing each metric, pass thresholds, and measurement method.\\n\\n2) Design human evaluation suite (2–4 days)\\n- Task: Create 50–200 human evaluation examples that cover easy/typical/hard/edge cases.

GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\\n- You are building an AI system intended to help with reasoning and problem parsing capabilities.\\n- The request does not include constraints, target domains, datasets, model choices, performance targets, or deployment requirements.\\n\\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\\n- State‑of‑the‑art models and leaderboards for reasoning tasks (e.g., GPT‑4, PaLM, LLaMA family, open and closed models): check arXiv.org, Papers With Code (paperswithcode.com), and recent conference proceedings (NeurIPS, ACL, ICLR).\\n- Relevant benchmarks and leaderboards (and their exact task definitions and metrics): GSM8K, MATH, MMLU, BIG‑Bench, ARC, DROP, AQuA, HumanEval — sources: Papers With Code pages for each dataset, the original dataset GitHub repos, and leaderboard pages on huggingface.co or paperswithcode.\\n- Best published prompting and training techniques for improving chain‑of‑thought and multi‑step reasoning (e.g., chain‑of‑thought, self‑consistency, prompting strategies, instruction tuning, RLHF): search arXiv, Google Scholar, and major ML conference proceedings.\\n- Semantic/structured parsing approaches and libraries for converting natural language problems into formal representations or programmatic solvers (e.g., semantic parsing literature, seq2seq-to-DSL methods, parser toolkits): look on arXiv, ACL/EMNLP papers, and GitHub repos (search keywords “semantic parsing”, “neural semantic parser”).\\n- Datasets and corpus for problem parsing (annotated NL→program pairs, math word problems, symbolic reasoning datasets): dataset GitHub pages and Papers With Code.\\n- Example implementations and open‑source toolkits (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, DeepSpeed, Fairseq): project docs and GitHub.\\n- Compute/cost estimates for training/fine‑tuning models (GPU/TPU instance types, pricing): cloud provider docs (AWS, GCP, Azure) and cost calculators; rough hardware requirements can be inferred from published training runs in papers.\\n- Evaluation methodologies for reasoning and parsing systems (automatic metrics, human evaluation protocols, robustness/adversarial tests): methodology sections of relevant papers and benchmark pages.\\n- Regulatory, data‑privacy, and safety guidance relevant to your target users/region (e.g., GDPR, CCPA): official government regulatory websites and legal guidance resources.\\n- Explainability/interpretability techniques appropriate to reasoning systems (e.g., attention analysis, attribution, symbolic traces): literature on interpretability (arXiv, conference papers) and tool docs (SHAP, Captum).\\n\\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\\n- The appropriate modeling approach (e.g., prompting a large closed model, fine‑tuning an open LLM, building a hybrid neuro‑symbolic pipeline) once you provide constraints (latency, budget, data availability, domain).\\n- Required dataset size and annotation budget to reach a target accuracy on chosen benchmarks or internal tasks.\\n- Estimated compute resources, wall‑clock training/fine‑tuning time, and monetary cost for each candidate approach (prototype vs. production).\\n- Expected benchmark performance given a chosen model family, dataset, and training regimen (can be estimated from published curves but requires mapping to your exact setup).\\n- Latency and throughput requirements derived from intended deployment scenario (interactive assistant vs. batch processing).\\n- Tradeoffs between options (e.g., few‑shot prompting vs. fine‑tuning vs. retrieval‑augmented generation vs. hybrid symbolic solvers) tailored to your constraints.\\n- A concrete evaluation suite (which metrics and tests to run) derived from your domain and user needs.\\n- The minimal viable pipeline decomposition (parsing → reasoning → verification → explanation) given your functional requirements.\\n\\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\\n- A practical system will likely combine a large transformer‑based model (for language understanding and chain‑of‑thought) with task‑specific symbolic or programmatic modules (for deterministic calculation, rule application, or verification).\\n- Common, high‑impact datasets to start prototyping: GSM8K (grade‑school math), MATH, MMLU, BIG‑Bench tasks relevant to reasoning, ARC, and HumanEval for programmatic outputs.\\n- Effective techniques to improve multi‑step reasoning early on: chain‑of‑thought prompting, few‑shot examples, self‑consistency sampling, and fine‑tuning on generated CoT annotations if you have labeled data.\\n- For parsing problems into executable forms, a seq2seq model that outputs a constrained DSL or executable Python (with strong validation/sandboxing) is a pragmatic approach; semantic parsing literature and program synthesis techniques will be directly relevant.\\n- For tooling and rapid iteration: Python + PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers/Hub, LangChain (for orchestration and retrieval), and use of open models for prototyping to avoid API cost.\\n- Prototype compute needs: you can experiment with small/medium models on a single GPU (e.g., 16–40 GB); fine‑tuning larger LLMs or training from scratch will require multi‑GPU/TPU setups and substantially higher cost.\\n- Typical evaluation: automatic accuracy on benchmark tasks plus a human evaluation loop for correctness, robustness, and quality of explanations; incorporate adversarial and edge‑case tests early.\\n- Likely development path: start with prompting and retrieval‑augmentation on an off‑the‑shelf LLM to validate task decomposition, then add fine‑tuning / modular symbolic components as needs for correctness and efficiency grow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\n- Clarify objectives and constraints (generator): gather target task types (math, commonsense, code), latency/budget/privacy requirements, and success metrics so the team has a concrete scope before building.\\n\\n- Inventory datasets and benchmarks (coder + generator): coder pulls candidate datasets (GSM8K, MATH, MMLU, domain-specific corpora) and sample problem formats; generator prioritizes which benchmarks matter for initial MVP.\\n\\n- Prototype reasoning-first baseline (coder): implement few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting against an off-the-shelf LLM (or open model) to validate capability without heavy engineering.\\n\\n- Prototype parsing-first baseline (coder): build a simple seq2seq semantic parser that maps problems to a constrained DSL or executable Python snippets, with sandboxed execution for verification.\\n\\n- Implement verification layer (verifier + coder): verifier defines correctness checks and edge-case tests; coder implements symbolic/unit-test based validators that run on parser outputs and LLM solutions (consistency checks, numeric equivalence).\\n\\n- Define and run evaluation suite (verifier): evaluate prototypes on automatic metrics (accuracy, execution success, F1 for parse quality) and a small human-eval sample for explanation quality and failure modes.\\n\\n- Iterate on hybrid pipeline (coder + verifier): combine LLM reasoning with programmatic parsing/verification—use LLM for parsing when uncertain, and deterministic modules for arithmetic or logical steps; verifier measures improvement and flags regressions.\\n\\n- Instrument explainability and traceability (coder + generator): coder logs parse trees, chain-of-thought traces, and verification results; generator drafts user-facing explanations and formats for outputs.\\n\\n- Plan data augmentation and fine-tuning (generator + coder): generator identifies annotation needs and templates for CoT/parse supervision; coder scripts synthetic data generation and small-scale fine-tuning experiments.\\n\\n- Decide deployment approach and next milestones (generator + verifier): generator recommends prototype vs production path (API vs local), and verifier sets acceptance criteria for launching an alpha; schedule iterative sprints based on those criteria.\\n\"}], 'author_name': 'magentic_manager', 'additional_properties': {}}\n",

For example, if the priority is math word problems, the MVP will accept plain English problem statements and return a concise numeric answer plus a short structured proof (optional). Target one standard benchmark for comparability (e.g., GSM8K for grade‑school math, HumanEval or MBPP for code generation, a curated 500‑example in‑house dev set for domain tasks). Minimum acceptance criteria: a development set accuracy of at least 60–80% (choose target per task difficulty), p95 inference latency under your stated limit (typical dev target: <2s via API or <500ms for cached/local microservice), and reproducible verification tests (automated checks pass on >=90% of held-out evaluation examples).

Start with zero‑shot, few‑shot (3–10 exemplars), CoT vs. answer‑only prompts, and simple output‑formatting instructions.\\n- Sample sizes: 200–500 dev examples; run 3–5 prompt variants (so ~1k–2.5k requests).\\n- Resources: API access or local inference nodes; if using API, reserve $200–$1,000 credits for experiments depending on model and number of runs; laptop/VM for scripting.\\n- Estimated time: 2–3 full workdays for setup and 1–2 days for a round of experiments/analysis.\\n- Output: ranked prompt templates, performance table (accuracy, examples of failures), recommended prompt for MVP.\\n\\n3) Lightweight semantic‑DSL parser prototype (5–10 days)\\n- Task: If outputs must be executable (programs, calculations, or structured logic), implement a small semantic DSL and a parser that maps LLM outputs to the DSL; include a validator and executor.

(Yes/No)\\n- Which features must ship in MVP vs can wait for later?\\n\\n7) Safety, interpretability, and regulatory constraints\\n- Explainability requirements (must always show reasoning, or only final answer).\\n- Audit/logging requirements (store prompts/responses, redaction needed, retention period).\\n- Regulatory constraints (GDPR data subject rights, industry-specific rules).\\n- Failure-mode handling: allowed to answer “I don’t know”, must escalate to human, etc.\\n\\nOptional: Additional context\\n- Key stakeholders and reviewers, sample users, and examples of unacceptable outputs.\\n\\nPRIORITIZED MVP (one paragraph)\\nBuild a focused MVP that supports one high‑priority problem type (pick the top‑ranked from your questionnaire) with a narrow input/output schema and deterministic postprocessing. For example, if the priority is math word problems, the MVP will accept plain English problem statements and return a concise numeric answer plus a short structured proof (optional). Target one standard benchmark for comparability (e.g., GSM8K for grade‑school math, HumanEval or MBPP for code generation, a curated 500‑example in‑house dev set for domain tasks). Minimum acceptance criteria: a development set accuracy of at least 60–80% (choose target per task difficulty), p95 inference latency under your stated limit (typical dev target: <2s via API or <500ms for cached/local microservice), and reproducible verification tests (automated checks pass on >=90% of held-out evaluation examples). Keep scope tight: support one input format, one output format, and one model/approach initially (e.g., API-based best-in-class LLM with prompt engineering) and defer fine-tuning or multi-model orchestration to next phase.\\n\\nIMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN — CODER (tasks, required resources, estimated time)\\n1) Data inventory and minimal canonical dataset (1–2 days)\\n- Task: Gather and format 200–500 representative examples across the chosen task into a canonical JSONL with fields {id, input, expected_output, reasoning_allowed:Boolean}.\\n- Resources: developer laptop/VM, text editor, ~2–4 hours of stakeholder interviews to collect examples.\\n- Output: canonical dev set (200–500 examples) and 50 example “hard negatives” if available.\\n\\n2) Quick prompting experiments (2–5 days)\\n- Task: Run iterative prompt‑engineering experiments against the chosen model class (closed API or open local). Start with zero‑shot, few‑shot (3–10 exemplars), CoT vs. answer‑only prompts, and simple output‑formatting instructions.\\n- Sample sizes: 200–500 dev examples; run 3–5 prompt variants (so ~1k–2.5k requests).\\n- Resources: API access or local inference nodes; if using API, reserve $200–$1,000 credits for experiments depending on model and number of runs; laptop/VM for scripting.\\n- Estimated time: 2–3 full workdays for setup and 1–2 days for a round of experiments/analysis.\\n- Output: ranked prompt templates, performance table (accuracy, examples of failures), recommended prompt for MVP.\\n\\n3) Lightweight semantic‑DSL parser prototype (5–10 days)\\n- Task: If outputs must be executable (programs, calculations, or structured logic), implement a small semantic DSL and a parser that maps LLM outputs to the DSL; include a validator and executor. Keep DSL minimal (e.g., arithmetic operators, loops/conditionals if needed, or a small AST for code generation).\\n- Implementation notes: Use Python; implement parser with a simple PEG/regex-based validator or an existing parsing library; include unit tests and sample executions.\\n- Resources: developer workstation, ~1–2 GB storage for code and test data.\\n- Sample sizes: 200 labeled pairs (NL→DSL or NL→program) to validate mapping; can be synthetic for early stages.\\n- Estimated time: 5–10 days for a minimally robust prototype (shorter if DSL is extremely small).\\n\\n4) (Optional) Small fine‑tuning / RCT (2–3 weeks)\\n- Task: If allowed and justified by prompt experiments, run a parameter‑efficient fine‑tune (LoRA or instruction tuning) on ~1k–5k examples.\\n- Compute: single GPU (A10 / T4 / 16‑32GB VRAM) for LoRA-style tuning; larger GPU for full fine-tune.\\n- Estimated time: 1–2 days for setup, 1–7 days for training depending on examples and compute.\\n- Note: Do this only after validating that prompts alone do not meet acceptance criteria.\\n\\nDeliverables for coder by end of prototype: canonical dataset, best prompt(s) and performance table, working DSL parser prototype with tests, and recommendation whether to fine-tune.\\n\\nIMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN — VERIFIER (tasks, required resources, estimated time)\\n1) Define evaluation metrics and automated checks (0.5–1 day)\\n- Task: Translate stakeholder success metrics into concrete tests:\\n  - Correctness: exact‑match, normalized numeric equality, or functional tests (for code: run unit tests).\\n  - Robustness: adversarial paraphrase checks.\\n  - Latency: p50/p95 measured under expected concurrency.\\n  - Safety: banned-phrases/PII redaction checks.\\n- Output: evaluation spec document listing each metric, pass thresholds, and measurement method.\\n\\n2) Design human evaluation suite (2–4 days)\\n- Task: Create 50–200 human evaluation examples that cover easy/typical/hard/edge cases. For each example, provide guidelines for human raters and an answer rubric (scoring 0–2 or 0–3).\\n- Sample sizing guidance:\\n  - Pilot: 50 examples, 3 raters each to estimate inter-annotator agreement.\\n  - Full: 200 examples, 3 raters each for stable estimates.\\n- Resources: internal annotators or crowd workers (estimate cost: a few USD per label depending on complexity). Time: design and test: 1–2 days; annotation round: dependent on workforce (few hours to 2 days).\\n- Output: human evaluation dataset and scoring rubric.\\n\\n3) Draft verification checks for parsing/execution (1–3 days)\\n- Task: For outputs that map to the DSL or to executable code:\\n  - Syntax validation: ensure parser accepts output into canonical AST; fail anything else.\\n  - Type/semantic checks: ensure variables/operations are valid (e.g., no divide by zero).\\n  - Deterministic execution tests: run on small synthetic test cases and compare expected outputs.\\n  - Safety checks: sandbox execution (no network/file access), resource/time limits.\\n- Resources: sandboxed execution environment (e.g., subprocess with timeouts or a container), unit test harness.\\n- Estimated time: 1–3 days to write checks and integrate into CI.\\n\\n4) Reporting and acceptance gating (0.5–1 day)\\n- Task: Define the gating rules for promoting to the next stage (e.g., “must pass automated tests at 90% and human eval >= target”).\\n- Output: acceptance checklist and release criteria.\\n\\nSUMMARY TIMELINE (example for 2–4 week prototype)\\n- Day 0–2: Send questionnaire; collect canonical examples; data inventory.\\n- Day 2–7: Prompting experiments + initial performance analysis.\\n- Day 5–12: DSL parser prototype + unit tests (overlapping with experiments).\\n- Day 8–14: Design human eval and automated verification checks; run pilot annotations.\\n- Optional Day 12–21: Fine-tuning experiments if needed.\\n- Deliverables at end of prototype: working demo, evaluation report, recommended next steps toward production.\\n\\nQuick practical recommendations\\n- Keep MVP single‑domain and single‑format. The simplest success case (e.g., numeric answers with a small proof or code functions with unit tests) gives the highest chance to meet targets quickly.\\n- Start with prompt engineering and structured output enforcement before costly fine‑tuning.\\n- Sandbox any execution and log prompts/responses for auditing, subject to privacy constraints.\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Convert the questionnaire into a fillable form (CSV/Google Form) or\\n- Draft the initial prompt templates and a minimal DSL grammar for the specific problem type you choose.\\n\\nWhich problem type should I assume for the initial prompt templates and DSL example? Provide your answers to the questionnaire (or the top 1–2 items) and I’ll generate the concrete prompts, a starter DSL grammar, and a test harness.'}], 'author_name': 'GeneratorAgent', 'additional_properties': {}}\n",

GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\\n- You are building an AI system intended to help with reasoning and problem parsing capabilities.\\n- The request does not include constraints, target domains, datasets, model choices, performance targets, or deployment requirements.\\n\\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\\n- State‑of‑the‑art models and leaderboards for reasoning tasks (e.g., GPT‑4, PaLM, LLaMA family, open and closed models): check arXiv.org, Papers With Code (paperswithcode.com), and recent conference proceedings (NeurIPS, ACL, ICLR).\\n- Relevant benchmarks and leaderboards (and their exact task definitions and metrics): GSM8K, MATH, MMLU, BIG‑Bench, ARC, DROP, AQuA, HumanEval — sources: Papers With Code pages for each dataset, the original dataset GitHub repos, and leaderboard pages on huggingface.co or paperswithcode.\\n- Best published prompting and training techniques for improving chain‑of‑thought and multi‑step reasoning (e.g., chain‑of‑thought, self‑consistency, prompting strategies, instruction tuning, RLHF): search arXiv, Google Scholar, and major ML conference proceedings.\\n- Semantic/structured parsing approaches and libraries for converting natural language problems into formal representations or programmatic solvers (e.g., semantic parsing literature, seq2seq-to-DSL methods, parser toolkits): look on arXiv, ACL/EMNLP papers, and GitHub repos (search keywords “semantic parsing”, “neural semantic parser”).\\n- Datasets and corpus for problem parsing (annotated NL→program pairs, math word problems, symbolic reasoning datasets): dataset GitHub pages and Papers With Code.\\n- Example implementations and open‑source toolkits (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, DeepSpeed, Fairseq): project docs and GitHub.\\n- Compute/cost estimates for training/fine‑tuning models (GPU/TPU instance types, pricing): cloud provider docs (AWS, GCP, Azure) and cost calculators; rough hardware requirements can be inferred from published training runs in papers.\\n- Evaluation methodologies for reasoning and parsing systems (automatic metrics, human evaluation protocols, robustness/adversarial tests): methodology sections of relevant papers and benchmark pages.\\n- Regulatory, data‑privacy, and safety guidance relevant to your target users/region (e.g., GDPR, CCPA): official government regulatory websites and legal guidance resources.\\n- Explainability/interpretability techniques appropriate to reasoning systems (e.g., attention analysis, attribution, symbolic traces): literature on interpretability (arXiv, conference papers) and tool docs (SHAP, Captum).\\n\\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\\n- The appropriate modeling approach (e.g., prompting a large closed model, fine‑tuning an open LLM, building a hybrid neuro‑symbolic pipeline) once you provide constraints (latency, budget, data availability, domain).\\n- Required dataset size and annotation budget to reach a target accuracy on chosen benchmarks or internal tasks.\\n- Estimated compute resources, wall‑clock training/fine‑tuning time, and monetary cost for each candidate approach (prototype vs. production).\\n- Expected benchmark performance given a chosen model family, dataset, and training regimen (can be estimated from published curves but requires mapping to your exact setup).\\n- Latency and throughput requirements derived from intended deployment scenario (interactive assistant vs. batch processing).\\n- Tradeoffs between options (e.g., few‑shot prompting vs. fine‑tuning vs. retrieval‑augmented generation vs. hybrid symbolic solvers) tailored to your constraints.\\n- A concrete evaluation suite (which metrics and tests to run) derived from your domain and user needs.\\n- The minimal viable pipeline decomposition (parsing → reasoning → verification → explanation) given your functional requirements.\\n\\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\\n- A practical system will likely combine a large transformer‑based model (for language understanding and chain‑of‑thought) with task‑specific symbolic or programmatic modules (for deterministic calculation, rule application, or verification).\\n- Common, high‑impact datasets to start prototyping: GSM8K (grade‑school math), MATH, MMLU, BIG‑Bench tasks relevant to reasoning, ARC, and HumanEval for programmatic outputs.\\n- Effective techniques to improve multi‑step reasoning early on: chain‑of‑thought prompting, few‑shot examples, self‑consistency sampling, and fine‑tuning on generated CoT annotations if you have labeled data.\\n- For parsing problems into executable forms, a seq2seq model that outputs a constrained DSL or executable Python (with strong validation/sandboxing) is a pragmatic approach; semantic parsing literature and program synthesis techniques will be directly relevant.\\n- For tooling and rapid iteration: Python + PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers/Hub, LangChain (for orchestration and retrieval), and use of open models for prototyping to avoid API cost.\\n- Prototype compute needs: you can experiment with small/medium models on a single GPU (e.g., 16–40 GB); fine‑tuning larger LLMs or training from scratch will require multi‑GPU/TPU setups and substantially higher cost.\\n- Typical evaluation: automatic accuracy on benchmark tasks plus a human evaluation loop for correctness, robustness, and quality of explanations; incorporate adversarial and edge‑case tests early.\\n- Likely development path: start with prompting and retrieval‑augmentation on an off‑the‑shelf LLM to validate task decomposition, then add fine‑tuning / modular symbolic components as needs for correctness and efficiency grow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\n- Clarify objectives and constraints (generator): gather target task types (math, commonsense, code), latency/budget/privacy requirements, and success metrics so the team has a concrete scope before building.\\n\\n- Inventory datasets and benchmarks (coder + generator): coder pulls candidate datasets (GSM8K, MATH, MMLU, domain-specific corpora) and sample problem formats; generator prioritizes which benchmarks matter for initial MVP.\\n\\n- Prototype reasoning-first baseline (coder): implement few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting against an off-the-shelf LLM (or open model) to validate capability without heavy engineering.\\n\\n- Prototype parsing-first baseline (coder): build a simple seq2seq semantic parser that maps problems to a constrained DSL or executable Python snippets, with sandboxed execution for verification.\\n\\n- Implement verification layer (verifier + coder): verifier defines correctness checks and edge-case tests; coder implements symbolic/unit-test based validators that run on parser outputs and LLM solutions (consistency checks, numeric equivalence).\\n\\n- Define and run evaluation suite (verifier): evaluate prototypes on automatic metrics (accuracy, execution success, F1 for parse quality) and a small human-eval sample for explanation quality and failure modes.\\n\\n- Iterate on hybrid pipeline (coder + verifier): combine LLM reasoning with programmatic parsing/verification—use LLM for parsing when uncertain, and deterministic modules for arithmetic or logical steps; verifier measures improvement and flags regressions.\\n\\n- Instrument explainability and traceability (coder + generator): coder logs parse trees, chain-of-thought traces, and verification results; generator drafts user-facing explanations and formats for outputs.\\n\\n- Plan data augmentation and fine-tuning (generator + coder): generator identifies annotation needs and templates for CoT/parse supervision; coder scripts synthetic data generation and small-scale fine-tuning experiments.\\n\\n- Decide deployment approach and next milestones (generator + verifier): generator recommends prototype vs production path (API vs local), and verifier sets acceptance criteria for launching an alpha; schedule iterative sprints based on those criteria.\\n\"}], 'author_name': 'magentic_manager', 'additional_properties': {}}\n",

Minimum acceptance criteria: a development set accuracy of at least 60–80% (choose target per task difficulty), p95 inference latency under your stated limit (typical dev target: <2s via API or <500ms for cached/local microservice), and reproducible verification tests (automated checks pass on >=90% of held-out evaluation examples).

Start with zero‑shot, few‑shot (3–10 exemplars), CoT vs. answer‑only prompts, and simple output‑formatting instructions.\\n- Sample sizes: 200–500 dev examples; run 3–5 prompt variants (so ~1k–2.5k requests).\\n- Resources: API access or local inference nodes; if using API, reserve $200–$1,000 credits for experiments depending on model and number of runs; laptop/VM for scripting.\\n- Estimated time: 2–3 full workdays for setup and 1–2 days for a round of experiments/analysis.\\n- Output: ranked prompt templates, performance table (accuracy, examples of failures), recommended prompt for MVP.\\n\\n3) Lightweight semantic‑DSL parser prototype (5–10 days)\\n- Task: If outputs must be executable (programs, calculations, or structured logic), implement a small semantic DSL and a parser that maps LLM outputs to the DSL; include a validator and executor. Keep DSL minimal (e.g., arithmetic operators, loops/conditionals if needed, or a small AST for code generation).\\n- Implementation notes: Use Python; implement parser with a simple PEG/regex-based validator or an existing parsing library; include unit tests and sample executions.\\n- Resources: developer workstation, ~1–2 GB storage for code and test data.\\n- Sample sizes: 200 labeled pairs (NL→DSL or NL→program) to validate mapping; can be synthetic for early stages.\\n- Estimated time: 5–10 days for a minimally robust prototype (shorter if DSL is extremely small).\\n\\n4) (Optional) Small fine‑tuning / RCT (2–3 weeks)\\n- Task: If allowed and justified by prompt experiments, run a parameter‑efficient fine‑tune (LoRA or instruction tuning) on ~1k–5k examples.\\n- Compute: single GPU (A10 / T4 / 16‑32GB VRAM) for LoRA-style tuning; larger GPU for full fine-tune.\\n- Estimated time: 1–2 days for setup, 1–7 days for training depending on examples and compute.\\n- Note: Do this only after validating that prompts alone do not meet acceptance criteria.\\n\\nDeliverables for coder by end of prototype: canonical dataset, best prompt(s) and performance table, working DSL parser prototype with tests, and recommendation whether to fine-tune.\\n\\nIMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN — VERIFIER (tasks, required resources, estimated time)\\n1) Define evaluation metrics and automated checks (0.5–1 day)\\n- Task: Translate stakeholder success metrics into concrete tests:\\n  - Correctness: exact‑match, normalized numeric equality, or functional tests (for code: run unit tests).\\n  - Robustness: adversarial paraphrase checks.\\n  - Latency: p50/p95 measured under expected concurrency.\\n  - Safety: banned-phrases/PII redaction checks.\\n- Output: evaluation spec document listing each metric, pass thresholds, and measurement method.\\n\\n2) Design human evaluation suite (2–4 days)\\n- Task: Create 50–200 human evaluation examples that cover easy/typical/hard/edge cases. For each example, provide guidelines for human raters and an answer rubric (scoring 0–2 or 0–3).\\n- Sample sizing guidance:\\n  - Pilot: 50 examples, 3 raters each to estimate inter-annotator agreement.\\n  - Full: 200 examples, 3 raters each for stable estimates.\\n- Resources: internal annotators or crowd workers (estimate cost: a few USD per label depending on complexity). Time: design and test: 1–2 days; annotation round: dependent on workforce (few hours to 2 days).\\n- Output: human evaluation dataset and scoring rubric.\\n\\n3) Draft verification checks for parsing/execution (1–3 days)\\n- Task: For outputs that map to the DSL or to executable code:\\n  - Syntax validation: ensure parser accepts output into canonical AST; fail anything else.\\n  - Type/semantic checks: ensure variables/operations are valid (e.g., no divide by zero).\\n  - Deterministic execution tests: run on small synthetic test cases and compare expected outputs.\\n  - Safety checks: sandbox execution (no network/file access), resource/time limits.\\n- Resources: sandboxed execution environment (e.g., subprocess with timeouts or a container), unit test harness.\\n- Estimated time: 1–3 days to write checks and integrate into CI.\\n\\n4) Reporting and acceptance gating (0.5–1 day)\\n- Task: Define the gating rules for promoting to the next stage (e.g., “must pass automated tests at 90% and human eval >= target”).\\n- Output: acceptance checklist and release criteria.\\n\\nSUMMARY TIMELINE (example for 2–4 week prototype)\\n- Day 0–2: Send questionnaire; collect canonical examples; data inventory.\\n- Day 2–7: Prompting experiments + initial performance analysis.\\n- Day 5–12: DSL parser prototype + unit tests (overlapping with experiments).\\n- Day 8–14: Design human eval and automated verification checks; run pilot annotations.\\n- Optional Day 12–21: Fine-tuning experiments if needed.\\n- Deliverables at end of prototype: working demo, evaluation report, recommended next steps toward production.\\n\\nQuick practical recommendations\\n- Keep MVP single‑domain and single‑format. The simplest success case (e.g., numeric answers with a small proof or code functions with unit tests) gives the highest chance to meet targets quickly.\\n- Start with prompt engineering and structured output enforcement before costly fine‑tuning.\\n- Sandbox any execution and log prompts/responses for auditing, subject to privacy constraints.\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Convert the questionnaire into a fillable form (CSV/Google Form) or\\n- Draft the initial prompt templates and a minimal DSL grammar for the specific problem type you choose.\\n\\nWhich problem type should I assume for the initial prompt templates and DSL example?

For each example state whether intermediate reasoning steps should be returned (e.g., chain‑of‑thought) or hidden.\\n  - Example format to copy for each example:\\n    - Input: \"...\"\\n    - Desired output: \"...\"\\n    - Return reasoning? Yes/No\\n- Priority across types: rank the chosen types 1 (highest)–N.\\n\\n2) Success metrics and targets\\n- Which automatic metrics matter? (examples: exact-match accuracy on benchmark X, token-level BLEU, pass@k for code, F1 for extraction, % correctness)\\n- Quantitative targets for each metric (e.g., “>= 75% exact-match on small dev set”, “latency <= 2s p50”).\\n- Latency and throughput requirements: max acceptable p95 latency, required concurrent throughput (requests/sec), required SLA (% uptime).\\n\\n3) Deployment / operational constraints\\n- Budget for API or infrastructure per month (range is fine).\\n- Privacy/data‑residency constraints (e.g., no PII leave our network, EU data must remain in EU, HIPAA, etc.).\\n- Allowed external APIs/services (yes/no) and any blacklisted integrations.\\n- Availability/constraints on deploying models (cloud only, on‑prem only, must use vendor X).\\n\\n4) Available data and annotation resources\\n- Existing datasets (names, sizes, formats — e.g., CSV of 10k Q/A pairs, repositories of problem statements, logs).\\n- Do you have human-labeled chain‑of‑thought (CoT) or NL→program pairs? If yes, how many and in which format?\\n- Labeling resources: internal annotators or access to crowd workers, available monthly labeling budget, expected time per label.\\n\\n5) Preferred model approach constraints\\n- Preference: closed commercial API (hosted) vs open models self-hosted vs hybrid.\\n- Fine-tuning allowed? (yes/no) If yes, which types (parameter‑efficient tuning, instruction‑tuning, full fine‑tune)?\\n- Compute availability: GPUs (type/quantity), CPUs, memory, and storage available for experiments and for production.\\n- Any cost constraints on model size or requests per second?\\n\\n6) Timeline and priority\\n- Target prototype timeline (e.g., prototype in 2–4 weeks?) and production timeline (e.g., 3 months).\\n- Is rapid demo a higher priority than production robustness? (Yes/No)\\n- Which features must ship in MVP vs can wait for later?\\n\\n7) Safety, interpretability, and regulatory constraints\\n- Explainability requirements (must always show reasoning, or only final answer).\\n- Audit/logging requirements (store prompts/responses, redaction needed, retention period).\\n- Regulatory constraints (GDPR data subject rights, industry-specific rules).\\n- Failure-mode handling: allowed to answer “I don’t know”, must escalate to human, etc.\\n\\nOptional: Additional context\\n- Key stakeholders and reviewers, sample users, and examples of unacceptable outputs.\\n\\nPRIORITIZED MVP (one paragraph)\\nBuild a focused MVP that supports one high‑priority problem type (pick the top‑ranked from your questionnaire) with a narrow input/output schema and deterministic postprocessing. For example, if the priority is math word problems, the MVP will accept plain English problem statements and return a concise numeric answer plus a short structured proof (optional). Target one standard benchmark for comparability (e.g., GSM8K for grade‑school math, HumanEval or MBPP for code generation, a curated 500‑example in‑house dev set for domain tasks). Minimum acceptance criteria: a development set accuracy of at least 60–80% (choose target per task difficulty), p95 inference latency under your stated limit (typical dev target: <2s via API or <500ms for cached/local microservice), and reproducible verification tests (automated checks pass on >=90% of held-out evaluation examples).

After collecting responses, produce a 1–page summary that (a) confirms the chosen MVP scope, (b) produces the canonical 200–500 example dev JSONL (or as many examples as they provided if fewer), and (c) issues clear next-step tickets for the coder (data ingestion + prompting experiments) and verifier (evaluation spec + 50-sample human-eval pilot).

Copy/paste and send as-is.\\n\\nSubject: Request — MVP scoping questionnaire (please return JSON/JSONL within 48 hours)\\n\\nHi all,\\n\\nWe’re scoping an MVP for an LLM-driven task and need structured inputs from stakeholders so the coder and verifier can begin work. Please reply with a single JSON object or a JSONL file attachment containing your answers within 48 hours.\\n\\nRequired items (please follow the JSON schema below exactly)\\n\\n1) Pick top problem type (required) and optionally a 2nd (optional). Examples: math word problems, logical puzzles, code generation, commonsense reasoning, info extraction, table lookup, etc.\\n- For the top (and optional 2nd) problem type provide exactly 3 representative example entries each, using this example template for each example:\\n  {\"id\": \"example-01\", \"input\": \"...\", \"desired_output\": \"...\", \"return_reasoning\": true|false}\\n\\n2) Success metrics and targets\\n- Specify which automatic metrics matter and numeric targets (e.g., exact-match accuracy on GSM8K >= 75%, pass@1 >= 40%, F1 >= 0.85, latency p50 <= 300ms, latency p95 <= 2s, required throughput RPS, uptime SLA).\\n\\n3) Deployment / operational constraints\\n- Monthly budget range for API/infrastructure.\\n- Privacy/data residency constraints (e.g., PII cannot leave network, EU-only residency, HIPAA).\\n- Allowed/blocked external APIs or vendors.\\n- Any hard constraints on where/model types can run (cloud only, on‑prem required).\\n\\n4) Available data and annotation resources\\n- List file names, counts, and formats (e.g., problems.csv — 12,000 rows, fields: id,input,answer; chats.jsonl — 15k; NL→program pairs in nl_programs.jsonl — 1,200).\\n- Whether you have human-labeled CoT or NL→program pairs (yes/no + approximate counts).\\n- Labeling capacity and budget (internal annotators or crowd, labels/day).\\n\\n5) Model approach preferences\\n- Preference: closed commercial API vs open models self-hosted vs hybrid.\\n- Fine-tuning allowed? If yes, whether PEFT (LoRA), instruction tuning, or full fine-tune is allowed.\\n- Compute available (GPU types & counts, CPU, memory).\\n- Any request-rate / cost constraints.\\n\\n6) Timeline & priorities\\n- Prototype timeline target (e.g., prototype in 2–4 weeks?).\\n- Production target (if any).\\n- Which features must be in the MVP vs can wait.\\n\\n7) Safety, interpretability, regulatory constraints\\n- Explainability needs (always show chain-of-thought vs final answer only).\\n- Audit/logging/retention rules.\\n- Regulatory constraints (GDPR, HIPAA, sector-specific).\\n- Required failure handling (e.g., “I don’t know”, escalate to human).\\n\\nIf you cannot provide everything within 48 hours: at minimum please specify the top problem type and supply 20 example input/output pairs (use the same example template). That will let the coder begin rapid prototyping.\\n\\nExact JSON schema to return\\nReturn one JSON object (recommended) or a JSONL file.

Below are:\\n\\n- A ready‑to‑send stakeholder message (copy/paste into email/Slack/ticket).\\n- Clear step‑by‑step instructions for the coordinator for collecting replies and producing a single JSON/JSONL.\\n- A one‑page summary template and the exact “tickets” to create for coder and verifier (with deadlines).\\n- A fallback: if stakeholders don’t reply within 48 hours, auto‑assume the top problem type is math word problems and start with 50 seed examples — provided below in the exact JSON schema you requested so the coder can begin prompt experiments immediately.\\n\\n1) Ready-to-send stakeholder message (send as email/Slack/ticket)\\nSubject: Urgent — MVP scoping questionnaire (please return JSON/JSONL within 48 hours)\\n\\nHi — we need structured inputs to scope the LLM MVP. Please reply with a single JSON object or a JSONL file attachment named mvp_responses.json or mvp_responses.jsonl within 48 hours.\\n\\nRequired items (exact schema below):\\n1) Pick the top problem type (required) and optionally a 2nd. For each top (and optional 2nd) type include exactly 3 representative examples using this template for each example:\\n  {\"id\":\"example-01\",\"input\":\"...\",\"desired_output\":\"...\",\"return_reasoning\":true|false}\\n\\n2) Success metrics and targets (e.g., exact-match accuracy target, latency p50/p95 in ms, throughput RPS, benchmark names).\\n\\n3) Deployment constraints (monthly budget range, privacy/data residency rules, allowed/blocked external APIs).\\n\\n4) Available data and annotation resources (file names, counts, formats), and labeling capacity.\\n\\n5) Model approach preferences (API vs self-host, fine-tuning allowed, compute available).\\n\\n6) Timeline & priorities (prototype timeline, production target, which features must be in MVP).\\n\\n7) Safety/regulatory constraints (explainability, logging, GDPR/HIPAA, failure handling).\\n\\nMinimum if you can’t fully respond: at least specify the top problem type and provide 20 example input/output pairs using the same example template above.\\n\\nExact top-level JSON structure we expect (example):\\n{\\n  \"stakeholder\":\"Team/Person\",\\n  \"contact_email\":\"name@example.com\",\\n  \"problem_types\":[\\n    {\\n      \"name\":\"math_word_problems\",\\n      \"priority\":1,\\n      \"examples\":[\\n        {\"id\":\"m1\",\"input\":\"If John has 3 apples and buys 2 more, how many apples?\",\"desired_output\":\"5\",\"return_reasoning\":false},\\n        {\"id\":\"m2\",\"input\":\"...\",\"desired_output\":\"...\",\"return_reasoning\":true},\\n        {\"id\":\"m3\",\"input\":\"...\",\"desired_output\":\"...\",\"return_reasoning\":false}\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"success_metrics\":{\"metrics\":[\"exact_match\",\"p95_latency_ms\"],\"targets\":{\"exact_match\":0.75,\"p95_latency_ms\":2000}},\\n  \"deployment_constraints\":{\"monthly_budget_usd\":\"$1k-$5k\",\"data_residency\":\"EU-only\",\"allowed_apis\":[\"vendorA\"],\"blocked_apis\":[\"vendorB\"],\"deployment\":\"cloud_only\"},\\n  \"available_data\":[{\"filename\":\"problems.csv\",\"count\":12000,\"format\":\"csv\",\"fields\":[\"id\",\"input\",\"answer\"]}],\\n  \"annotation_resources\":{\"has_CoT\":true,\"CoT_count\":500,\"labeling_budget_usd_per_month\":2000},\\n  \"model_preferences\":{\"preference\":\"closed_api\",\"fine_tuning_allowed\":false,\"compute_available\":\"none\"},\\n  \"timeline_priority\":{\"prototype_weeks\":3,\"production_months\":3,\"demo_priority\":\"demo_first\"},\\n  \"safety_constraints\":{\"explainability\":\"show_short_reasoning\",\"audit_log\":\"store_prompts_30d\",\"gdpr\":true},\\n  \"notes\":\"...\"\\n}\\n\\nDelivery: attach the JSON/JSONL file or provide a share link. If using Google Drive, Dropbox, or a ticket system, upload mvp_responses.json and reply here with the link.\\n\\nIf you need help converting CSV/YAML to the JSON schema, reply and I’ll provide a conversion helper snippet.\\n\\nThank you — please return within 48 hours.\\n\\n2) Coordinator instructions to collect responses and produce a single JSON or JSONL file\\n- Send the message above via the agreed channel immediately.\\n- Schedule one reminder at 24 hours and a final reminder at 6 hours before the 48‑hour deadline.\\n- When replies arrive:\\n  - If they send a single JSON or JSONL: validate top-level keys (stakeholder, problem_types, etc.). If valid, save as mvp_responses_<stakeholder>.json.\\n  - If they send multiple emails/files: convert each into one JSON object and append as lines to a single JSONL file where each line is one stakeholder object. Save as all_mvp_responses.jsonl.\\n- Validation checklist (simple):\\n  - Each problem_types entry has name, priority, and exactly 3 examples.\\n  - Each example is {\"id\",\"input\",\"desired_output\",\"return_reasoning\":true|false}.\\n  - success_metrics and deployment_constraints are present.\\n- If any response is missing required fields, e-mail the stakeholder asking for the missing items and give them 24 hours to update.\\n- Place the final all_mvp_responses.jsonl into the shared project folder /project/mvp_inputs/mvp_responses.jsonl and set permissions for coder and verifier.\\n\\n3) One‑page summary template (to create after responses are collected)\\nFilename: /project/mvp_outputs/mvp_summary_<date>.pdf (or .md/.txt)\\nContents (single page):\\n- Header: Project, Date, Collected from: [list stakeholders]\\n- Confirmed MVP scope: [Chosen top problem type] — brief description (one sentence). Constraints: [budget, residency, model prefs].\\n- Target benchmarks & acceptance criteria: [e.g., exact-match >= X, p95 latency <= Y ms, throughput RPS = Z]\\n- Canonical dev dataset: [path in shared folder] — includes N examples (if <200, note that we will bootstrap to 200–500).\\n- Tickets created and owners:\\n  - Ticket 1 (Coder): Ingest canonical data; run prompt experiments; produce ranked prompt templates; implement minimal DSL parser prototype; deliverables + due date (48 hours after summary delivery to start; progress check in 7 days).\\n  - Ticket 2 (Verifier): Produce evaluation spec; design 50-sample human-eval pilot; design automated parsing/execution checks; deliverables + due date (start within 48 hours after summary delivery; pilot ready in 7 days).\\n- Immediate next steps and deadlines:\\n  - Deadline: coder and verifier to begin within 48 hours of summary delivery.\\n  - If stakeholders delayed beyond their 48-hour window, fallback was triggered on [date] — using math word problems seeds (path /project/mvp_inputs/math_seed_50.json).\\n\\n4) Tickets — exact text to create (copy/paste to ticketing system)\\n\\nTicket A — Coder: data ingestion + prompt experiments + DSL prototype\\nTitle: MVP Coder — ingest canonical data, run prompt experiments, implement minimal DSL parser\\nDescription:\\n- Input: /project/mvp_inputs/mvp_responses.jsonl (or math_seed_50.json fallback).\\n- Tasks:\\n  1) Ingest canonical examples into canonical_dev.jsonl (target 200–500 examples). If fewer provided, pad with auto-generated examples as instructed in the summary.\\n  2) Run prompt experiments: zero-shot, few-shot (3–10 exemplars), CoT vs answer-only, output-format enforcement. Use 200 dev examples for initial evaluation and 3–5 prompt variants. Produce performance table (accuracy, representative successes/failures).\\n  3) Implement minimal semantic DSL parser prototype (Python). Keep grammar minimal; include syntax validator and executor sandbox.\\n- Deliverables:\\n  - canonical_dev.jsonl in /project/mvp_inputs/\\n  - report: prompt variants + performance table\\n  - DSL prototype repository link and unit tests\\n- Start: within 48 hours of summary delivery\\n- Progress check: 7 days after start\\n- Estimate: 2 weeks for prototype\\nOwner: [coder name]\\nPriority: High\\n\\nTicket B — Verifier: evaluation spec + human-eval pilot\\nTitle: MVP Verifier — define evaluation metrics and run 50-sample human-eval pilot\\nDescription:\\n- Tasks:\\n  1) Translate stakeholder success metrics into concrete automated tests (exact-match rules, numeric normalization, unit tests for code, p50/p95 latency measurement).\\n  2) Design a 50-sample human evaluation pilot covering easy/typical/hard/edge cases. Provide detailed annotation rubric for 3 raters and calculate inter-annotator agreement.\\n  3) Implement parsing/execution verification checks (syntax validator, semantic checks, sandboxed execution with time/resource limits).\\n- Deliverables:\\n  - evaluation_spec.md in /project/mvp_outputs/\\n  - human_eval_50.jsonl and annotation rubric\\n  - automated test harness for parsing/execution\\n- Start: within 48 hours of summary delivery\\n- Progress check: 7 days after start\\nOwner: [verifier name]\\nPriority: High\\n\\nNotification templates to coder & verifier (send when summary + canonical dataset placed)\\nSubject: Start work — MVP tasks ready (start within 48 hours)\\nBody: The MVP summary and canonical dataset are in /project/mvp_inputs/ and /project/mvp_outputs/. You must begin within 48 hours. See tickets [Ticket A link], [Ticket B link] for details. Progress check scheduled for [date 7 days later]. Contact [project lead] with blockers.\\n\\n5) Fallback policy (trigger if stakeholders fail to deliver full answers in 48 hours)\\n- Coordinator marks fallback triggered and notifies team.\\n- Assumption: top problem type = math_word_problems.\\n- Action: place math_seed_50.json in /project/mvp_inputs/ and notify coder that prompt experiments should begin immediately using those 50 examples; verifier should prepare evaluation spec and the 50-sample pilot using the seeded examples.\\n- I’ve generated 50 seed math examples below in the exact JSON schema so you can drop them into math_seed_50.json and place them in the shared folder.\\n\\n6) 50 seed math word problems (JSON array)\\nUse this JSON array as math_seed_50.json.

FACTS TO LOOK UP\\n- State‑of‑the‑art models and leaderboards for reasoning tasks (e.g., GPT‑4, PaLM, LLaMA family, open and closed models): check arXiv.org, Papers With Code (paperswithcode.com), and recent conference proceedings (NeurIPS, ACL, ICLR).\\n- Relevant benchmarks and leaderboards (and their exact task definitions and metrics): GSM8K, MATH, MMLU, BIG‑Bench, ARC, DROP, AQuA, HumanEval — sources: Papers With Code pages for each dataset, the original dataset GitHub repos, and leaderboard pages on huggingface.co or paperswithcode.\\n- Best published prompting and training techniques for improving chain‑of‑thought and multi‑step reasoning (e.g., chain‑of‑thought, self‑consistency, prompting strategies, instruction tuning, RLHF): search arXiv, Google Scholar, and major ML conference proceedings.\\n- Semantic/structured parsing approaches and libraries for converting natural language problems into formal representations or programmatic solvers (e.g., semantic parsing literature, seq2seq-to-DSL methods, parser toolkits): look on arXiv, ACL/EMNLP papers, and GitHub repos (search keywords “semantic parsing”, “neural semantic parser”).\\n- Datasets and corpus for problem parsing (annotated NL→program pairs, math word problems, symbolic reasoning datasets): dataset GitHub pages and Papers With Code.\\n- Example implementations and open‑source toolkits (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, DeepSpeed, Fairseq): project docs and GitHub.\\n- Compute/cost estimates for training/fine‑tuning models (GPU/TPU instance types, pricing): cloud provider docs (AWS, GCP, Azure) and cost calculators; rough hardware requirements can be inferred from published training runs in papers.\\n- Evaluation methodologies for reasoning and parsing systems (automatic metrics, human evaluation protocols, robustness/adversarial tests): methodology sections of relevant papers and benchmark pages.\\n- Regulatory, data‑privacy, and safety guidance relevant to your target users/region (e.g., GDPR, CCPA): official government regulatory websites and legal guidance resources.\\n- Explainability/interpretability techniques appropriate to reasoning systems (e.g., attention analysis, attribution, symbolic traces): literature on interpretability (arXiv, conference papers) and tool docs (SHAP, Captum).\\n\\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\\n- The appropriate modeling approach (e.g., prompting a large closed model, fine‑tuning an open LLM, building a hybrid neuro‑symbolic pipeline) once you provide constraints (latency, budget, data availability, domain).\\n- Required dataset size and annotation budget to reach a target accuracy on chosen benchmarks or internal tasks.\\n- Estimated compute resources, wall‑clock training/fine‑tuning time, and monetary cost for each candidate approach (prototype vs. production).\\n- Expected benchmark performance given a chosen model family, dataset, and training regimen (can be estimated from published curves but requires mapping to your exact setup).\\n- Latency and throughput requirements derived from intended deployment scenario (interactive assistant vs. batch processing).\\n- Tradeoffs between options (e.g., few‑shot prompting vs. fine‑tuning vs. retrieval‑augmented generation vs. hybrid symbolic solvers) tailored to your constraints.\\n- A concrete evaluation suite (which metrics and tests to run) derived from your domain and user needs.\\n- The minimal viable pipeline decomposition (parsing → reasoning → verification → explanation) given your functional requirements.\\n\\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\\n- A practical system will likely combine a large transformer‑based model (for language understanding and chain‑of‑thought) with task‑specific symbolic or programmatic modules (for deterministic calculation, rule application, or verification).\\n- Common, high‑impact datasets to start prototyping: GSM8K (grade‑school math), MATH, MMLU, BIG‑Bench tasks relevant to reasoning, ARC, and HumanEval for programmatic outputs.\\n- Effective techniques to improve multi‑step reasoning early on: chain‑of‑thought prompting, few‑shot examples, self‑consistency sampling, and fine‑tuning on generated CoT annotations if you have labeled data.\\n- For parsing problems into executable forms, a seq2seq model that outputs a constrained DSL or executable Python (with strong validation/sandboxing) is a pragmatic approach; semantic parsing literature and program synthesis techniques will be directly relevant.\\n- For tooling and rapid iteration: Python + PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers/Hub, LangChain (for orchestration and retrieval), and use of open models for prototyping to avoid API cost.\\n- Prototype compute needs: you can experiment with small/medium models on a single GPU (e.g., 16–40 GB); fine‑tuning larger LLMs or training from scratch will require multi‑GPU/TPU setups and substantially higher cost.\\n- Typical evaluation: automatic accuracy on benchmark tasks plus a human evaluation loop for correctness, robustness, and quality of explanations; incorporate adversarial and edge‑case tests early.\\n- Likely development path: start with prompting and retrieval‑augmentation on an off‑the‑shelf LLM to validate task decomposition, then add fine‑tuning / modular symbolic components as needs for correctness and efficiency grow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\n- Clarify objectives and constraints (generator): gather target task types (math, commonsense, code), latency/budget/privacy requirements, and success metrics so the team has a concrete scope before building.\\n\\n- Inventory datasets and benchmarks (coder + generator): coder pulls candidate datasets (GSM8K, MATH, MMLU, domain-specific corpora) and sample problem formats; generator prioritizes which benchmarks matter for initial MVP.\\n\\n- Prototype reasoning-first baseline (coder): implement few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting against an off-the-shelf LLM (or open model) to validate capability without heavy engineering.\\n\\n- Prototype parsing-first baseline (coder): build a simple seq2seq semantic parser that maps problems to a constrained DSL or executable Python snippets, with sandboxed execution for verification.\\n\\n- Implement verification layer (verifier + coder): verifier defines correctness checks and edge-case tests; coder implements symbolic/unit-test based validators that run on parser outputs and LLM solutions (consistency checks, numeric equivalence).\\n\\n- Define and run evaluation suite (verifier): evaluate prototypes on automatic metrics (accuracy, execution success, F1 for parse quality) and a small human-eval sample for explanation quality and failure modes.\\n\\n- Iterate on hybrid pipeline (coder + verifier): combine LLM reasoning with programmatic parsing/verification—use LLM for parsing when uncertain, and deterministic modules for arithmetic or logical steps; verifier measures improvement and flags regressions.\\n\\n- Instrument explainability and traceability (coder + generator): coder logs parse trees, chain-of-thought traces, and verification results; generator drafts user-facing explanations and formats for outputs.\\n\\n- Plan data augmentation and fine-tuning (generator + coder): generator identifies annotation needs and templates for CoT/parse supervision; coder scripts synthetic data generation and small-scale fine-tuning experiments.\\n\\n- Decide deployment approach and next milestones (generator + verifier): generator recommends prototype vs production path (API vs local), and verifier sets acceptance criteria for launching an alpha; schedule iterative sprints based on those criteria.\\n\"}], 'author_name': 'magentic_manager', 'additional_properties': {}}\n",

For example, if the priority is math word problems, the MVP will accept plain English problem statements and return a concise numeric answer plus a short structured proof (optional). Target one standard benchmark for comparability (e.g., GSM8K for grade‑school math, HumanEval or MBPP for code generation, a curated 500‑example in‑house dev set for domain tasks). Minimum acceptance criteria: a development set accuracy of at least 60–80% (choose target per task difficulty), p95 inference latency under your stated limit (typical dev target: <2s via API or <500ms for cached/local microservice), and reproducible verification tests (automated checks pass on >=90% of held-out evaluation examples).

Start with zero‑shot, few‑shot (3–10 exemplars), CoT vs. answer‑only prompts, and simple output‑formatting instructions.\\n- Sample sizes: 200–500 dev examples; run 3–5 prompt variants (so ~1k–2.5k requests).\\n- Resources: API access or local inference nodes; if using API, reserve $200–$1,000 credits for experiments depending on model and number of runs; laptop/VM for scripting.\\n- Estimated time: 2–3 full workdays for setup and 1–2 days for a round of experiments/analysis.\\n- Output: ranked prompt templates, performance table (accuracy, examples of failures), recommended prompt for MVP.\\n\\n3) Lightweight semantic‑DSL parser prototype (5–10 days)\\n- Task: If outputs must be executable (programs, calculations, or structured logic), implement a small semantic DSL and a parser that maps LLM outputs to the DSL; include a validator and executor. Keep DSL minimal (e.g., arithmetic operators, loops/conditionals if needed, or a small AST for code generation).\\n- Implementation notes: Use Python; implement parser with a simple PEG/regex-based validator or an existing parsing library; include unit tests and sample executions.\\n- Resources: developer workstation, ~1–2 GB storage for code and test data.\\n- Sample sizes: 200 labeled pairs (NL→DSL or NL→program) to validate mapping; can be synthetic for early stages.\\n- Estimated time: 5–10 days for a minimally robust prototype (shorter if DSL is extremely small).\\n\\n4) (Optional) Small fine‑tuning / RCT (2–3 weeks)\\n- Task: If allowed and justified by prompt experiments, run a parameter‑efficient fine‑tune (LoRA or instruction tuning) on ~1k–5k examples.\\n- Compute: single GPU (A10 / T4 / 16‑32GB VRAM) for LoRA-style tuning; larger GPU for full fine-tune.\\n- Estimated time: 1–2 days for setup, 1–7 days for training depending on examples and compute.\\n- Note: Do this only after validating that prompts alone do not meet acceptance criteria.\\n\\nDeliverables for coder by end of prototype: canonical dataset, best prompt(s) and performance table, working DSL parser prototype with tests, and recommendation whether to fine-tune.\\n\\nIMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN — VERIFIER (tasks, required resources, estimated time)\\n1) Define evaluation metrics and automated checks (0.5–1 day)\\n- Task: Translate stakeholder success metrics into concrete tests:\\n  - Correctness: exact‑match, normalized numeric equality, or functional tests (for code: run unit tests).\\n  - Robustness: adversarial paraphrase checks.\\n  - Latency: p50/p95 measured under expected concurrency.\\n  - Safety: banned-phrases/PII redaction checks.\\n- Output: evaluation spec document listing each metric, pass thresholds, and measurement method.\\n\\n2) Design human evaluation suite (2–4 days)\\n- Task: Create 50–200 human evaluation examples that cover easy/typical/hard/edge cases. For each example, provide guidelines for human raters and an answer rubric (scoring 0–2 or 0–3).\\n- Sample sizing guidance:\\n  - Pilot: 50 examples, 3 raters each to estimate inter-annotator agreement.\\n  - Full: 200 examples, 3 raters each for stable estimates.\\n- Resources: internal annotators or crowd workers (estimate cost: a few USD per label depending on complexity). Time: design and test: 1–2 days; annotation round: dependent on workforce (few hours to 2 days).\\n- Output: human evaluation dataset and scoring rubric.\\n\\n3) Draft verification checks for parsing/execution (1–3 days)\\n- Task: For outputs that map to the DSL or to executable code:\\n  - Syntax validation: ensure parser accepts output into canonical AST; fail anything else.\\n  - Type/semantic checks: ensure variables/operations are valid (e.g., no divide by zero).\\n  - Deterministic execution tests: run on small synthetic test cases and compare expected outputs.\\n  - Safety checks: sandbox execution (no network/file access), resource/time limits.\\n- Resources: sandboxed execution environment (e.g., subprocess with timeouts or a container), unit test harness.\\n- Estimated time: 1–3 days to write checks and integrate into CI.\\n\\n4) Reporting and acceptance gating (0.5–1 day)\\n- Task: Define the gating rules for promoting to the next stage (e.g., “must pass automated tests at 90% and human eval >= target”).\\n- Output: acceptance checklist and release criteria.\\n\\nSUMMARY TIMELINE (example for 2–4 week prototype)\\n- Day 0–2: Send questionnaire; collect canonical examples; data inventory.\\n- Day 2–7: Prompting experiments + initial performance analysis.\\n- Day 5–12: DSL parser prototype + unit tests (overlapping with experiments).\\n- Day 8–14: Design human eval and automated verification checks; run pilot annotations.\\n- Optional Day 12–21: Fine-tuning experiments if needed.\\n- Deliverables at end of prototype: working demo, evaluation report, recommended next steps toward production.\\n\\nQuick practical recommendations\\n- Keep MVP single‑domain and single‑format. The simplest success case (e.g., numeric answers with a small proof or code functions with unit tests) gives the highest chance to meet targets quickly.\\n- Start with prompt engineering and structured output enforcement before costly fine‑tuning.\\n- Sandbox any execution and log prompts/responses for auditing, subject to privacy constraints.\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Convert the questionnaire into a fillable form (CSV/Google Form) or\\n- Draft the initial prompt templates and a minimal DSL grammar for the specific problem type you choose.\\n\\nWhich problem type should I assume for the initial prompt templates and DSL example?

Send the questionnaire to the relevant stakeholders, get the answers, then use the action plans to start the project.\\n\\nQUESTIONNAIRE (please answer each item as fully as possible)\\n1) Target problem types and domains\\n- Which problem types should the system handle? (pick any: math word problems, logical puzzles, code generation, commonsense reasoning, table lookup, information extraction, etc.)\\n- For each chosen type, provide 3 representative example inputs and the exact desired outputs (include any preferred output format, e.g., “final numeric answer”, “annotated steps”, “executable code”). For each example state whether intermediate reasoning steps should be returned (e.g., chain‑of‑thought) or hidden.\\n  - Example format to copy for each example:\\n    - Input: \"...\"\\n    - Desired output: \"...\"\\n    - Return reasoning? Yes/No\\n- Priority across types: rank the chosen types 1 (highest)–N.\\n\\n2) Success metrics and targets\\n- Which automatic metrics matter? (examples: exact-match accuracy on benchmark X, token-level BLEU, pass@k for code, F1 for extraction, % correctness)\\n- Quantitative targets for each metric (e.g., “>= 75% exact-match on small dev set”, “latency <= 2s p50”).\\n- Latency and throughput requirements: max acceptable p95 latency, required concurrent throughput (requests/sec), required SLA (% uptime).\\n\\n3) Deployment / operational constraints\\n- Budget for API or infrastructure per month (range is fine).\\n- Privacy/data‑residency constraints (e.g., no PII leave our network, EU data must remain in EU, HIPAA, etc.).\\n- Allowed external APIs/services (yes/no) and any blacklisted integrations.\\n- Availability/constraints on deploying models (cloud only, on‑prem only, must use vendor X).\\n\\n4) Available data and annotation resources\\n- Existing datasets (names, sizes, formats — e.g., CSV of 10k Q/A pairs, repositories of problem statements, logs).\\n- Do you have human-labeled chain‑of‑thought (CoT) or NL→program pairs? If yes, how many and in which format?\\n- Labeling resources: internal annotators or access to crowd workers, available monthly labeling budget, expected time per label.\\n\\n5) Preferred model approach constraints\\n- Preference: closed commercial API (hosted) vs open models self-hosted vs hybrid.\\n- Fine-tuning allowed? (yes/no) If yes, which types (parameter‑efficient tuning, instruction‑tuning, full fine‑tune)?\\n- Compute availability: GPUs (type/quantity), CPUs, memory, and storage available for experiments and for production.\\n- Any cost constraints on model size or requests per second?\\n\\n6) Timeline and priority\\n- Target prototype timeline (e.g., prototype in 2–4 weeks?) and production timeline (e.g., 3 months).\\n- Is rapid demo a higher priority than production robustness? (Yes/No)\\n- Which features must ship in MVP vs can wait for later?\\n\\n7) Safety, interpretability, and regulatory constraints\\n- Explainability requirements (must always show reasoning, or only final answer).\\n- Audit/logging requirements (store prompts/responses, redaction needed, retention period).\\n- Regulatory constraints (GDPR data subject rights, industry-specific rules).\\n- Failure-mode handling: allowed to answer “I don’t know”, must escalate to human, etc.\\n\\nOptional: Additional context\\n- Key stakeholders and reviewers, sample users, and examples of unacceptable outputs.\\n\\nPRIORITIZED MVP (one paragraph)\\nBuild a focused MVP that supports one high‑priority problem type (pick the top‑ranked from your questionnaire) with a narrow input/output schema and deterministic postprocessing. For example, if the priority is math word problems, the MVP will accept plain English problem statements and return a concise numeric answer plus a short structured proof (optional). Target one standard benchmark for comparability (e.g., GSM8K for grade‑school math, HumanEval or MBPP for code generation, a curated 500‑example in‑house dev set for domain tasks). Minimum acceptance criteria: a development set accuracy of at least 60–80% (choose target per task difficulty), p95 inference latency under your stated limit (typical dev target: <2s via API or <500ms for cached/local microservice), and reproducible verification tests (automated checks pass on >=90% of held-out evaluation examples). Keep scope tight: support one input format, one output format, and one model/approach initially (e.g., API-based best-in-class LLM with prompt engineering) and defer fine-tuning or multi-model orchestration to next phase.\\n\\nIMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN — CODER (tasks, required resources, estimated time)\\n1) Data inventory and minimal canonical dataset (1–2 days)\\n- Task: Gather and format 200–500 representative examples across the chosen task into a canonical JSONL with fields {id, input, expected_output, reasoning_allowed:Boolean}.\\n- Resources: developer laptop/VM, text editor, ~2–4 hours of stakeholder interviews to collect examples.\\n- Output: canonical dev set (200–500 examples) and 50 example “hard negatives” if available.\\n\\n2) Quick prompting experiments (2–5 days)\\n- Task: Run iterative prompt‑engineering experiments against the chosen model class (closed API or open local). Start with zero‑shot, few‑shot (3–10 exemplars), CoT vs. answer‑only prompts, and simple output‑formatting instructions.\\n- Sample sizes: 200–500 dev examples; run 3–5 prompt variants (so ~1k–2.5k requests).\\n- Resources: API access or local inference nodes; if using API, reserve $200–$1,000 credits for experiments depending on model and number of runs; laptop/VM for scripting.\\n- Estimated time: 2–3 full workdays for setup and 1–2 days for a round of experiments/analysis.\\n- Output: ranked prompt templates, performance table (accuracy, examples of failures), recommended prompt for MVP.\\n\\n3) Lightweight semantic‑DSL parser prototype (5–10 days)\\n- Task: If outputs must be executable (programs, calculations, or structured logic), implement a small semantic DSL and a parser that maps LLM outputs to the DSL; include a validator and executor. Keep DSL minimal (e.g., arithmetic operators, loops/conditionals if needed, or a small AST for code generation).\\n- Implementation notes: Use Python; implement parser with a simple PEG/regex-based validator or an existing parsing library; include unit tests and sample executions.\\n- Resources: developer workstation, ~1–2 GB storage for code and test data.\\n- Sample sizes: 200 labeled pairs (NL→DSL or NL→program) to validate mapping; can be synthetic for early stages.\\n- Estimated time: 5–10 days for a minimally robust prototype (shorter if DSL is extremely small).\\n\\n4) (Optional) Small fine‑tuning / RCT (2–3 weeks)\\n- Task: If allowed and justified by prompt experiments, run a parameter‑efficient fine‑tune (LoRA or instruction tuning) on ~1k–5k examples.\\n- Compute: single GPU (A10 / T4 / 16‑32GB VRAM) for LoRA-style tuning; larger GPU for full fine-tune.\\n- Estimated time: 1–2 days for setup, 1–7 days for training depending on examples and compute.\\n- Note: Do this only after validating that prompts alone do not meet acceptance criteria.\\n\\nDeliverables for coder by end of prototype: canonical dataset, best prompt(s) and performance table, working DSL parser prototype with tests, and recommendation whether to fine-tune.\\n\\nIMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN — VERIFIER (tasks, required resources, estimated time)\\n1) Define evaluation metrics and automated checks (0.5–1 day)\\n- Task: Translate stakeholder success metrics into concrete tests:\\n  - Correctness: exact‑match, normalized numeric equality, or functional tests (for code: run unit tests).\\n  - Robustness: adversarial paraphrase checks.\\n  - Latency: p50/p95 measured under expected concurrency.\\n  - Safety: banned-phrases/PII redaction checks.\\n- Output: evaluation spec document listing each metric, pass thresholds, and measurement method.\\n\\n2) Design human evaluation suite (2–4 days)\\n- Task: Create 50–200 human evaluation examples that cover easy/typical/hard/edge cases. For each example, provide guidelines for human raters and an answer rubric (scoring 0–2 or 0–3).\\n- Sample sizing guidance:\\n  - Pilot: 50 examples, 3 raters each to estimate inter-annotator agreement.\\n  - Full: 200 examples, 3 raters each for stable estimates.\\n- Resources: internal annotators or crowd workers (estimate cost: a few USD per label depending on complexity). Time: design and test: 1–2 days; annotation round: dependent on workforce (few hours to 2 days).\\n- Output: human evaluation dataset and scoring rubric.\\n\\n3) Draft verification checks for parsing/execution (1–3 days)\\n- Task: For outputs that map to the DSL or to executable code:\\n  - Syntax validation: ensure parser accepts output into canonical AST; fail anything else.\\n  - Type/semantic checks: ensure variables/operations are valid (e.g., no divide by zero).\\n  - Deterministic execution tests: run on small synthetic test cases and compare expected outputs.\\n  - Safety checks: sandbox execution (no network/file access), resource/time limits.\\n- Resources: sandboxed execution environment (e.g., subprocess with timeouts or a container), unit test harness.\\n- Estimated time: 1–3 days to write checks and integrate into CI.\\n\\n4) Reporting and acceptance gating (0.5–1 day)\\n- Task: Define the gating rules for promoting to the next stage (e.g., “must pass automated tests at 90% and human eval >= target”).\\n- Output: acceptance checklist and release criteria.\\n\\nSUMMARY TIMELINE (example for 2–4 week prototype)\\n- Day 0–2: Send questionnaire; collect canonical examples; data inventory.\\n- Day 2–7: Prompting experiments + initial performance analysis.\\n- Day 5–12: DSL parser prototype + unit tests (overlapping with experiments).\\n- Day 8–14: Design human eval and automated verification checks; run pilot annotations.\\n- Optional Day 12–21: Fine-tuning experiments if needed.\\n- Deliverables at end of prototype: working demo, evaluation report, recommended next steps toward production.\\n\\nQuick practical recommendations\\n- Keep MVP single‑domain and single‑format. The simplest success case (e.g., numeric answers with a small proof or code functions with unit tests) gives the highest chance to meet targets quickly.\\n- Start with prompt engineering and structured output enforcement before costly fine‑tuning.\\n- Sandbox any execution and log prompts/responses for auditing, subject to privacy constraints.\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Convert the questionnaire into a fillable form (CSV/Google Form) or\\n- Draft the initial prompt templates and a minimal DSL grammar for the specific problem type you choose.\\n\\nWhich problem type should I assume for the initial prompt templates and DSL example? Provide your answers to the questionnaire (or the top 1–2 items) and I’ll generate the concrete prompts, a starter DSL grammar, and a test harness.'}], 'author_name': 'GeneratorAgent', 'additional_properties': {}}\n",

(pick any: math word problems, logical puzzles, code generation, commonsense reasoning, table lookup, information extraction, etc.)\\n- For each chosen type, provide 3 representative example inputs and the exact desired outputs (include any preferred output format, e.g., “final numeric answer”, “annotated steps”, “executable code”). For each example state whether intermediate reasoning steps should be returned (e.g., chain‑of‑thought) or hidden.\\n  - Example format to copy for each example:\\n    - Input: \"...\"\\n    - Desired output: \"...\"\\n    - Return reasoning? Yes/No\\n- Priority across types: rank the chosen types 1 (highest)–N.\\n\\n2) Success metrics and targets\\n- Which automatic metrics matter? (examples: exact-match accuracy on benchmark X, token-level BLEU, pass@k for code, F1 for extraction, % correctness)\\n- Quantitative targets for each metric (e.g., “>= 75% exact-match on small dev set”, “latency <= 2s p50”).\\n- Latency and throughput requirements: max acceptable p95 latency, required concurrent throughput (requests/sec), required SLA (% uptime).\\n\\n3) Deployment / operational constraints\\n- Budget for API or infrastructure per month (range is fine).\\n- Privacy/data‑residency constraints (e.g., no PII leave our network, EU data must remain in EU, HIPAA, etc.).\\n- Allowed external APIs/services (yes/no) and any blacklisted integrations.\\n- Availability/constraints on deploying models (cloud only, on‑prem only, must use vendor X).\\n\\n4) Available data and annotation resources\\n- Existing datasets (names, sizes, formats — e.g., CSV of 10k Q/A pairs, repositories of problem statements, logs).\\n- Do you have human-labeled chain‑of‑thought (CoT) or NL→program pairs? If yes, how many and in which format?\\n- Labeling resources: internal annotators or access to crowd workers, available monthly labeling budget, expected time per label.\\n\\n5) Preferred model approach constraints\\n- Preference: closed commercial API (hosted) vs open models self-hosted vs hybrid.\\n- Fine-tuning allowed? (yes/no) If yes, which types (parameter‑efficient tuning, instruction‑tuning, full fine‑tune)?\\n- Compute availability: GPUs (type/quantity), CPUs, memory, and storage available for experiments and for production.\\n- Any cost constraints on model size or requests per second?\\n\\n6) Timeline and priority\\n- Target prototype timeline (e.g., prototype in 2–4 weeks?) and production timeline (e.g., 3 months).\\n- Is rapid demo a higher priority than production robustness? (Yes/No)\\n- Which features must ship in MVP vs can wait for later?\\n\\n7) Safety, interpretability, and regulatory constraints\\n- Explainability requirements (must always show reasoning, or only final answer).\\n- Audit/logging requirements (store prompts/responses, redaction needed, retention period).\\n- Regulatory constraints (GDPR data subject rights, industry-specific rules).\\n- Failure-mode handling: allowed to answer “I don’t know”, must escalate to human, etc.\\n\\nOptional: Additional context\\n- Key stakeholders and reviewers, sample users, and examples of unacceptable outputs.\\n\\nPRIORITIZED MVP (one paragraph)\\nBuild a focused MVP that supports one high‑priority problem type (pick the top‑ranked from your questionnaire) with a narrow input/output schema and deterministic postprocessing. For example, if the priority is math word problems, the MVP will accept plain English problem statements and return a concise numeric answer plus a short structured proof (optional). Target one standard benchmark for comparability (e.g., GSM8K for grade‑school math, HumanEval or MBPP for code generation, a curated 500‑example in‑house dev set for domain tasks). Minimum acceptance criteria: a development set accuracy of at least 60–80% (choose target per task difficulty), p95 inference latency under your stated limit (typical dev target: <2s via API or <500ms for cached/local microservice), and reproducible verification tests (automated checks pass on >=90% of held-out evaluation examples). Keep scope tight: support one input format, one output format, and one model/approach initially (e.g., API-based best-in-class LLM with prompt engineering) and defer fine-tuning or multi-model orchestration to next phase.\\n\\nIMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN — CODER (tasks, required resources, estimated time)\\n1) Data inventory and minimal canonical dataset (1–2 days)\\n- Task: Gather and format 200–500 representative examples across the chosen task into a canonical JSONL with fields {id, input, expected_output, reasoning_allowed:Boolean}.\\n- Resources: developer laptop/VM, text editor, ~2–4 hours of stakeholder interviews to collect examples.\\n- Output: canonical dev set (200–500 examples) and 50 example “hard negatives” if available.\\n\\n2) Quick prompting experiments (2–5 days)\\n- Task: Run iterative prompt‑engineering experiments against the chosen model class (closed API or open local). Start with zero‑shot, few‑shot (3–10 exemplars), CoT vs. answer‑only prompts, and simple output‑formatting instructions.\\n- Sample sizes: 200–500 dev examples; run 3–5 prompt variants (so ~1k–2.5k requests).\\n- Resources: API access or local inference nodes; if using API, reserve $200–$1,000 credits for experiments depending on model and number of runs; laptop/VM for scripting.\\n- Estimated time: 2–3 full workdays for setup and 1–2 days for a round of experiments/analysis.\\n- Output: ranked prompt templates, performance table (accuracy, examples of failures), recommended prompt for MVP.\\n\\n3) Lightweight semantic‑DSL parser prototype (5–10 days)\\n- Task: If outputs must be executable (programs, calculations, or structured logic), implement a small semantic DSL and a parser that maps LLM outputs to the DSL; include a validator and executor. Keep DSL minimal (e.g., arithmetic operators, loops/conditionals if needed, or a small AST for code generation).\\n- Implementation notes: Use Python; implement parser with a simple PEG/regex-based validator or an existing parsing library; include unit tests and sample executions.\\n- Resources: developer workstation, ~1–2 GB storage for code and test data.\\n- Sample sizes: 200 labeled pairs (NL→DSL or NL→program) to validate mapping; can be synthetic for early stages.\\n- Estimated time: 5–10 days for a minimally robust prototype (shorter if DSL is extremely small).\\n\\n4) (Optional) Small fine‑tuning / RCT (2–3 weeks)\\n- Task: If allowed and justified by prompt experiments, run a parameter‑efficient fine‑tune (LoRA or instruction tuning) on ~1k–5k examples.\\n- Compute: single GPU (A10 / T4 / 16‑32GB VRAM) for LoRA-style tuning; larger GPU for full fine-tune.\\n- Estimated time: 1–2 days for setup, 1–7 days for training depending on examples and compute.\\n- Note: Do this only after validating that prompts alone do not meet acceptance criteria.\\n\\nDeliverables for coder by end of prototype: canonical dataset, best prompt(s) and performance table, working DSL parser prototype with tests, and recommendation whether to fine-tune.\\n\\nIMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN — VERIFIER (tasks, required resources, estimated time)\\n1) Define evaluation metrics and automated checks (0.5–1 day)\\n- Task: Translate stakeholder success metrics into concrete tests:\\n  - Correctness: exact‑match, normalized numeric equality, or functional tests (for code: run unit tests).\\n  - Robustness: adversarial paraphrase checks.\\n  - Latency: p50/p95 measured under expected concurrency.\\n  - Safety: banned-phrases/PII redaction checks.\\n- Output: evaluation spec document listing each metric, pass thresholds, and measurement method.\\n\\n2) Design human evaluation suite (2–4 days)\\n- Task: Create 50–200 human evaluation examples that cover easy/typical/hard/edge cases. For each example, provide guidelines for human raters and an answer rubric (scoring 0–2 or 0–3).\\n- Sample sizing guidance:\\n  - Pilot: 50 examples, 3 raters each to estimate inter-annotator agreement.\\n  - Full: 200 examples, 3 raters each for stable estimates.\\n- Resources: internal annotators or crowd workers (estimate cost: a few USD per label depending on complexity). Time: design and test: 1–2 days; annotation round: dependent on workforce (few hours to 2 days).\\n- Output: human evaluation dataset and scoring rubric.\\n\\n3) Draft verification checks for parsing/execution (1–3 days)\\n- Task: For outputs that map to the DSL or to executable code:\\n  - Syntax validation: ensure parser accepts output into canonical AST; fail anything else.\\n  - Type/semantic checks: ensure variables/operations are valid (e.g., no divide by zero).\\n  - Deterministic execution tests: run on small synthetic test cases and compare expected outputs.\\n  - Safety checks: sandbox execution (no network/file access), resource/time limits.\\n- Resources: sandboxed execution environment (e.g., subprocess with timeouts or a container), unit test harness.\\n- Estimated time: 1–3 days to write checks and integrate into CI.\\n\\n4) Reporting and acceptance gating (0.5–1 day)\\n- Task: Define the gating rules for promoting to the next stage (e.g., “must pass automated tests at 90% and human eval >= target”).\\n- Output: acceptance checklist and release criteria.\\n\\nSUMMARY TIMELINE (example for 2–4 week prototype)\\n- Day 0–2: Send questionnaire; collect canonical examples; data inventory.\\n- Day 2–7: Prompting experiments + initial performance analysis.\\n- Day 5–12: DSL parser prototype + unit tests (overlapping with experiments).\\n- Day 8–14: Design human eval and automated verification checks; run pilot annotations.\\n- Optional Day 12–21: Fine-tuning experiments if needed.\\n- Deliverables at end of prototype: working demo, evaluation report, recommended next steps toward production.\\n\\nQuick practical recommendations\\n- Keep MVP single‑domain and single‑format. The simplest success case (e.g., numeric answers with a small proof or code functions with unit tests) gives the highest chance to meet targets quickly.\\n- Start with prompt engineering and structured output enforcement before costly fine‑tuning.\\n- Sandbox any execution and log prompts/responses for auditing, subject to privacy constraints.\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Convert the questionnaire into a fillable form (CSV/Google Form) or\\n- Draft the initial prompt templates and a minimal DSL grammar for the specific problem type you choose.\\n\\nWhich problem type should I assume for the initial prompt templates and DSL example?

Examples: math word problems, logical puzzles, code generation, commonsense reasoning, info extraction, table lookup, etc.\\n- For the top (and optional 2nd) problem type provide exactly 3 representative example entries each, using this example template for each example:\\n  {\"id\": \"example-01\", \"input\": \"...\", \"desired_output\": \"...\", \"return_reasoning\": true|false}\\n\\n2) Success metrics and targets\\n- Specify which automatic metrics matter and numeric targets (e.g., exact-match accuracy on GSM8K >= 75%, pass@1 >= 40%, F1 >= 0.85, latency p50 <= 300ms, latency p95 <= 2s, required throughput RPS, uptime SLA).\\n\\n3) Deployment / operational constraints\\n- Monthly budget range for API/infrastructure.\\n- Privacy/data residency constraints (e.g., PII cannot leave network, EU-only residency, HIPAA).\\n- Allowed/blocked external APIs or vendors.\\n- Any hard constraints on where/model types can run (cloud only, on‑prem required).\\n\\n4) Available data and annotation resources\\n- List file names, counts, and formats (e.g., problems.csv — 12,000 rows, fields: id,input,answer; chats.jsonl — 15k; NL→program pairs in nl_programs.jsonl — 1,200).\\n- Whether you have human-labeled CoT or NL→program pairs (yes/no + approximate counts).\\n- Labeling capacity and budget (internal annotators or crowd, labels/day).\\n\\n5) Model approach preferences\\n- Preference: closed commercial API vs open models self-hosted vs hybrid.\\n- Fine-tuning allowed? If yes, whether PEFT (LoRA), instruction tuning, or full fine-tune is allowed.\\n- Compute available (GPU types & counts, CPU, memory).\\n- Any request-rate / cost constraints.\\n\\n6) Timeline & priorities\\n- Prototype timeline target (e.g., prototype in 2–4 weeks?).\\n- Production target (if any).\\n- Which features must be in the MVP vs can wait.\\n\\n7) Safety, interpretability, regulatory constraints\\n- Explainability needs (always show chain-of-thought vs final answer only).\\n- Audit/logging/retention rules.\\n- Regulatory constraints (GDPR, HIPAA, sector-specific).\\n- Required failure handling (e.g., “I don’t know”, escalate to human).\\n\\nIf you cannot provide everything within 48 hours: at minimum please specify the top problem type and supply 20 example input/output pairs (use the same example template). That will let the coder begin rapid prototyping.\\n\\nExact JSON schema to return\\nReturn one JSON object (recommended) or a JSONL file.

GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\\n- You are building an AI system intended to help with reasoning and problem parsing capabilities.\\n- The request does not include constraints, target domains, datasets, model choices, performance targets, or deployment requirements.\\n\\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\\n- State‑of‑the‑art models and leaderboards for reasoning tasks (e.g., GPT‑4, PaLM, LLaMA family, open and closed models): check arXiv.org, Papers With Code (paperswithcode.com), and recent conference proceedings (NeurIPS, ACL, ICLR).\\n- Relevant benchmarks and leaderboards (and their exact task definitions and metrics): GSM8K, MATH, MMLU, BIG‑Bench, ARC, DROP, AQuA, HumanEval — sources: Papers With Code pages for each dataset, the original dataset GitHub repos, and leaderboard pages on huggingface.co or paperswithcode.\\n- Best published prompting and training techniques for improving chain‑of‑thought and multi‑step reasoning (e.g., chain‑of‑thought, self‑consistency, prompting strategies, instruction tuning, RLHF): search arXiv, Google Scholar, and major ML conference proceedings.\\n- Semantic/structured parsing approaches and libraries for converting natural language problems into formal representations or programmatic solvers (e.g., semantic parsing literature, seq2seq-to-DSL methods, parser toolkits): look on arXiv, ACL/EMNLP papers, and GitHub repos (search keywords “semantic parsing”, “neural semantic parser”).\\n- Datasets and corpus for problem parsing (annotated NL→program pairs, math word problems, symbolic reasoning datasets): dataset GitHub pages and Papers With Code.\\n- Example implementations and open‑source toolkits (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, DeepSpeed, Fairseq): project docs and GitHub.\\n- Compute/cost estimates for training/fine‑tuning models (GPU/TPU instance types, pricing): cloud provider docs (AWS, GCP, Azure) and cost calculators; rough hardware requirements can be inferred from published training runs in papers.\\n- Evaluation methodologies for reasoning and parsing systems (automatic metrics, human evaluation protocols, robustness/adversarial tests): methodology sections of relevant papers and benchmark pages.\\n- Regulatory, data‑privacy, and safety guidance relevant to your target users/region (e.g., GDPR, CCPA): official government regulatory websites and legal guidance resources.\\n- Explainability/interpretability techniques appropriate to reasoning systems (e.g., attention analysis, attribution, symbolic traces): literature on interpretability (arXiv, conference papers) and tool docs (SHAP, Captum).\\n\\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\\n- The appropriate modeling approach (e.g., prompting a large closed model, fine‑tuning an open LLM, building a hybrid neuro‑symbolic pipeline) once you provide constraints (latency, budget, data availability, domain).\\n- Required dataset size and annotation budget to reach a target accuracy on chosen benchmarks or internal tasks.\\n- Estimated compute resources, wall‑clock training/fine‑tuning time, and monetary cost for each candidate approach (prototype vs. production).\\n- Expected benchmark performance given a chosen model family, dataset, and training regimen (can be estimated from published curves but requires mapping to your exact setup).\\n- Latency and throughput requirements derived from intended deployment scenario (interactive assistant vs. batch processing).\\n- Tradeoffs between options (e.g., few‑shot prompting vs. fine‑tuning vs. retrieval‑augmented generation vs. hybrid symbolic solvers) tailored to your constraints.\\n- A concrete evaluation suite (which metrics and tests to run) derived from your domain and user needs.\\n- The minimal viable pipeline decomposition (parsing → reasoning → verification → explanation) given your functional requirements.\\n\\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\\n- A practical system will likely combine a large transformer‑based model (for language understanding and chain‑of‑thought) with task‑specific symbolic or programmatic modules (for deterministic calculation, rule application, or verification).\\n- Common, high‑impact datasets to start prototyping: GSM8K (grade‑school math), MATH, MMLU, BIG‑Bench tasks relevant to reasoning, ARC, and HumanEval for programmatic outputs.\\n- Effective techniques to improve multi‑step reasoning early on: chain‑of‑thought prompting, few‑shot examples, self‑consistency sampling, and fine‑tuning on generated CoT annotations if you have labeled data.\\n- For parsing problems into executable forms, a seq2seq model that outputs a constrained DSL or executable Python (with strong validation/sandboxing) is a pragmatic approach; semantic parsing literature and program synthesis techniques will be directly relevant.\\n- For tooling and rapid iteration: Python + PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers/Hub, LangChain (for orchestration and retrieval), and use of open models for prototyping to avoid API cost.\\n- Prototype compute needs: you can experiment with small/medium models on a single GPU (e.g., 16–40 GB); fine‑tuning larger LLMs or training from scratch will require multi‑GPU/TPU setups and substantially higher cost.\\n- Typical evaluation: automatic accuracy on benchmark tasks plus a human evaluation loop for correctness, robustness, and quality of explanations; incorporate adversarial and edge‑case tests early.\\n- Likely development path: start with prompting and retrieval‑augmentation on an off‑the‑shelf LLM to validate task decomposition, then add fine‑tuning / modular symbolic components as needs for correctness and efficiency grow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\n- Clarify objectives and constraints (generator): gather target task types (math, commonsense, code), latency/budget/privacy requirements, and success metrics so the team has a concrete scope before building.\\n\\n- Inventory datasets and benchmarks (coder + generator): coder pulls candidate datasets (GSM8K, MATH, MMLU, domain-specific corpora) and sample problem formats; generator prioritizes which benchmarks matter for initial MVP.\\n\\n- Prototype reasoning-first baseline (coder): implement few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting against an off-the-shelf LLM (or open model) to validate capability without heavy engineering.\\n\\n- Prototype parsing-first baseline (coder): build a simple seq2seq semantic parser that maps problems to a constrained DSL or executable Python snippets, with sandboxed execution for verification.\\n\\n- Implement verification layer (verifier + coder): verifier defines correctness checks and edge-case tests; coder implements symbolic/unit-test based validators that run on parser outputs and LLM solutions (consistency checks, numeric equivalence).\\n\\n- Define and run evaluation suite (verifier): evaluate prototypes on automatic metrics (accuracy, execution success, F1 for parse quality) and a small human-eval sample for explanation quality and failure modes.\\n\\n- Iterate on hybrid pipeline (coder + verifier): combine LLM reasoning with programmatic parsing/verification—use LLM for parsing when uncertain, and deterministic modules for arithmetic or logical steps; verifier measures improvement and flags regressions.\\n\\n- Instrument explainability and traceability (coder + generator): coder logs parse trees, chain-of-thought traces, and verification results; generator drafts user-facing explanations and formats for outputs.\\n\\n- Plan data augmentation and fine-tuning (generator + coder): generator identifies annotation needs and templates for CoT/parse supervision; coder scripts synthetic data generation and small-scale fine-tuning experiments.\\n\\n- Decide deployment approach and next milestones (generator + verifier): generator recommends prototype vs production path (API vs local), and verifier sets acceptance criteria for launching an alpha; schedule iterative sprints based on those criteria.\\n\"}], 'author_name': 'magentic_manager', 'additional_properties': {}}\n",

Target one standard benchmark for comparability (e.g., GSM8K for grade‑school math, HumanEval or MBPP for code generation, a curated 500‑example in‑house dev set for domain tasks). Minimum acceptance criteria: a development set accuracy of at least 60–80% (choose target per task difficulty), p95 inference latency under your stated limit (typical dev target: <2s via API or <500ms for cached/local microservice), and reproducible verification tests (automated checks pass on >=90% of held-out evaluation examples). Keep scope tight: support one input format, one output format, and one model/approach initially (e.g., API-based best-in-class LLM with prompt engineering) and defer fine-tuning or multi-model orchestration to next phase.\\n\\nIMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN — CODER (tasks, required resources, estimated time)\\n1) Data inventory and minimal canonical dataset (1–2 days)\\n- Task: Gather and format 200–500 representative examples across the chosen task into a canonical JSONL with fields {id, input, expected_output, reasoning_allowed:Boolean}.\\n- Resources: developer laptop/VM, text editor, ~2–4 hours of stakeholder interviews to collect examples.\\n- Output: canonical dev set (200–500 examples) and 50 example “hard negatives” if available.\\n\\n2) Quick prompting experiments (2–5 days)\\n- Task: Run iterative prompt‑engineering experiments against the chosen model class (closed API or open local). Start with zero‑shot, few‑shot (3–10 exemplars), CoT vs. answer‑only prompts, and simple output‑formatting instructions.\\n- Sample sizes: 200–500 dev examples; run 3–5 prompt variants (so ~1k–2.5k requests).\\n- Resources: API access or local inference nodes; if using API, reserve $200–$1,000 credits for experiments depending on model and number of runs; laptop/VM for scripting.\\n- Estimated time: 2–3 full workdays for setup and 1–2 days for a round of experiments/analysis.\\n- Output: ranked prompt templates, performance table (accuracy, examples of failures), recommended prompt for MVP.\\n\\n3) Lightweight semantic‑DSL parser prototype (5–10 days)\\n- Task: If outputs must be executable (programs, calculations, or structured logic), implement a small semantic DSL and a parser that maps LLM outputs to the DSL; include a validator and executor. Keep DSL minimal (e.g., arithmetic operators, loops/conditionals if needed, or a small AST for code generation).\\n- Implementation notes: Use Python; implement parser with a simple PEG/regex-based validator or an existing parsing library; include unit tests and sample executions.\\n- Resources: developer workstation, ~1–2 GB storage for code and test data.\\n- Sample sizes: 200 labeled pairs (NL→DSL or NL→program) to validate mapping; can be synthetic for early stages.\\n- Estimated time: 5–10 days for a minimally robust prototype (shorter if DSL is extremely small).\\n\\n4) (Optional) Small fine‑tuning / RCT (2–3 weeks)\\n- Task: If allowed and justified by prompt experiments, run a parameter‑efficient fine‑tune (LoRA or instruction tuning) on ~1k–5k examples.\\n- Compute: single GPU (A10 / T4 / 16‑32GB VRAM) for LoRA-style tuning; larger GPU for full fine-tune.\\n- Estimated time: 1–2 days for setup, 1–7 days for training depending on examples and compute.\\n- Note: Do this only after validating that prompts alone do not meet acceptance criteria.\\n\\nDeliverables for coder by end of prototype: canonical dataset, best prompt(s) and performance table, working DSL parser prototype with tests, and recommendation whether to fine-tune.\\n\\nIMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN — VERIFIER (tasks, required resources, estimated time)\\n1) Define evaluation metrics and automated checks (0.5–1 day)\\n- Task: Translate stakeholder success metrics into concrete tests:\\n  - Correctness: exact‑match, normalized numeric equality, or functional tests (for code: run unit tests).\\n  - Robustness: adversarial paraphrase checks.\\n  - Latency: p50/p95 measured under expected concurrency.\\n  - Safety: banned-phrases/PII redaction checks.\\n- Output: evaluation spec document listing each metric, pass thresholds, and measurement method.\\n\\n2) Design human evaluation suite (2–4 days)\\n- Task: Create 50–200 human evaluation examples that cover easy/typical/hard/edge cases. For each example, provide guidelines for human raters and an answer rubric (scoring 0–2 or 0–3).\\n- Sample sizing guidance:\\n  - Pilot: 50 examples, 3 raters each to estimate inter-annotator agreement.\\n  - Full: 200 examples, 3 raters each for stable estimates.\\n- Resources: internal annotators or crowd workers (estimate cost: a few USD per label depending on complexity). Time: design and test: 1–2 days; annotation round: dependent on workforce (few hours to 2 days).\\n- Output: human evaluation dataset and scoring rubric.\\n\\n3) Draft verification checks for parsing/execution (1–3 days)\\n- Task: For outputs that map to the DSL or to executable code:\\n  - Syntax validation: ensure parser accepts output into canonical AST; fail anything else.\\n  - Type/semantic checks: ensure variables/operations are valid (e.g., no divide by zero).\\n  - Deterministic execution tests: run on small synthetic test cases and compare expected outputs.\\n  - Safety checks: sandbox execution (no network/file access), resource/time limits.\\n- Resources: sandboxed execution environment (e.g., subprocess with timeouts or a container), unit test harness.\\n- Estimated time: 1–3 days to write checks and integrate into CI.\\n\\n4) Reporting and acceptance gating (0.5–1 day)\\n- Task: Define the gating rules for promoting to the next stage (e.g., “must pass automated tests at 90% and human eval >= target”).\\n- Output: acceptance checklist and release criteria.\\n\\nSUMMARY TIMELINE (example for 2–4 week prototype)\\n- Day 0–2: Send questionnaire; collect canonical examples; data inventory.\\n- Day 2–7: Prompting experiments + initial performance analysis.\\n- Day 5–12: DSL parser prototype + unit tests (overlapping with experiments).\\n- Day 8–14: Design human eval and automated verification checks; run pilot annotations.\\n- Optional Day 12–21: Fine-tuning experiments if needed.\\n- Deliverables at end of prototype: working demo, evaluation report, recommended next steps toward production.\\n\\nQuick practical recommendations\\n- Keep MVP single‑domain and single‑format. The simplest success case (e.g., numeric answers with a small proof or code functions with unit tests) gives the highest chance to meet targets quickly.\\n- Start with prompt engineering and structured output enforcement before costly fine‑tuning.\\n- Sandbox any execution and log prompts/responses for auditing, subject to privacy constraints.\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Convert the questionnaire into a fillable form (CSV/Google Form) or\\n- Draft the initial prompt templates and a minimal DSL grammar for the specific problem type you choose.\\n\\nWhich problem type should I assume for the initial prompt templates and DSL example?

Contact [project lead] with blockers.\\n\\n7) How to run everything (quick sequence)\\n- Step A: Run send_questionnaire.py (or send the message manually).\\n- Step B: After replies arrive, save them into project/mvp_inputs/replies/.\\n- Step C: Run python merge_and_validate.py — this will create all_mvp_responses.jsonl (and report any validation errors).\\n- Step D: Run python generate_summary_and_canonical.py — this writes /project/mvp_outputs/mvp_summary.md and /project/mvp_inputs/canonical_dev.jsonl.\\n- Step E: Run ./ticket_create.sh (after filling API placeholders) then record returned ticket IDs in /project/mvp_outputs/tickets_log.txt.\\n- Step F: Run python notify_team.py to send start notifications.\\n- Step G: If, after 48 hours, all_mvp_responses.jsonl is empty, place math_seed_50.json into /project/mvp_inputs/ and re-run generate_summary_and_canonical.py in fallback mode; then notify coder & verifier to begin immediately.\\n\\n8) Audit and logs\\n- Save all communications, attachments, and generated files into /project/mvp_inputs/ (replies) and /project/mvp_outputs/ (summary, tickets_log.txt).\\n- Keep a simple CSV log: timestamp, action, actor, path_or_url for traceability.\\n\\n9) Offer of help\\nIf you want, I will:\\n- Produce the full contents of math_seed_50.json (complete array) formatted for immediate paste.\\n- Produce finalized versions of each Python script with the questionnaire body embedded and ready to run (you’ll only need to fill in endpoints/credentials).\\n- Produce a GitHub Actions workflow or cron job snippet to run reminders and fallback automation.\\n\\nTell me which of the above you want me to produce now (full scripts, full 50-item JSON, GH Actions YAML, or a conversion helper), and I will generate the code/text for direct copy/paste. Once your coordinator runs the scripts and creates tickets, paste the ticket IDs/links here and I’ll draft the follow-up plan and the initial prompt templates/DSL grammar for the coder.'}], 'author_name': 'GeneratorAgent', 'additional_properties': {}}\n",

GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\\n- You are building an AI system intended to help with reasoning and problem parsing capabilities.\\n- The request does not include constraints, target domains, datasets, model choices, performance targets, or deployment requirements.\\n\\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\\n- State‑of‑the‑art models and leaderboards for reasoning tasks (e.g., GPT‑4, PaLM, LLaMA family, open and closed models): check arXiv.org, Papers With Code (paperswithcode.com), and recent conference proceedings (NeurIPS, ACL, ICLR).\\n- Relevant benchmarks and leaderboards (and their exact task definitions and metrics): GSM8K, MATH, MMLU, BIG‑Bench, ARC, DROP, AQuA, HumanEval — sources: Papers With Code pages for each dataset, the original dataset GitHub repos, and leaderboard pages on huggingface.co or paperswithcode.\\n- Best published prompting and training techniques for improving chain‑of‑thought and multi‑step reasoning (e.g., chain‑of‑thought, self‑consistency, prompting strategies, instruction tuning, RLHF): search arXiv, Google Scholar, and major ML conference proceedings.\\n- Semantic/structured parsing approaches and libraries for converting natural language problems into formal representations or programmatic solvers (e.g., semantic parsing literature, seq2seq-to-DSL methods, parser toolkits): look on arXiv, ACL/EMNLP papers, and GitHub repos (search keywords “semantic parsing”, “neural semantic parser”).\\n- Datasets and corpus for problem parsing (annotated NL→program pairs, math word problems, symbolic reasoning datasets): dataset GitHub pages and Papers With Code.\\n- Example implementations and open‑source toolkits (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, DeepSpeed, Fairseq): project docs and GitHub.\\n- Compute/cost estimates for training/fine‑tuning models (GPU/TPU instance types, pricing): cloud provider docs (AWS, GCP, Azure) and cost calculators; rough hardware requirements can be inferred from published training runs in papers.\\n- Evaluation methodologies for reasoning and parsing systems (automatic metrics, human evaluation protocols, robustness/adversarial tests): methodology sections of relevant papers and benchmark pages.\\n- Regulatory, data‑privacy, and safety guidance relevant to your target users/region (e.g., GDPR, CCPA): official government regulatory websites and legal guidance resources.\\n- Explainability/interpretability techniques appropriate to reasoning systems (e.g., attention analysis, attribution, symbolic traces): literature on interpretability (arXiv, conference papers) and tool docs (SHAP, Captum).\\n\\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\\n- The appropriate modeling approach (e.g., prompting a large closed model, fine‑tuning an open LLM, building a hybrid neuro‑symbolic pipeline) once you provide constraints (latency, budget, data availability, domain).\\n- Required dataset size and annotation budget to reach a target accuracy on chosen benchmarks or internal tasks.\\n- Estimated compute resources, wall‑clock training/fine‑tuning time, and monetary cost for each candidate approach (prototype vs. production).\\n- Expected benchmark performance given a chosen model family, dataset, and training regimen (can be estimated from published curves but requires mapping to your exact setup).\\n- Latency and throughput requirements derived from intended deployment scenario (interactive assistant vs. batch processing).\\n- Tradeoffs between options (e.g., few‑shot prompting vs. fine‑tuning vs. retrieval‑augmented generation vs. hybrid symbolic solvers) tailored to your constraints.\\n- A concrete evaluation suite (which metrics and tests to run) derived from your domain and user needs.\\n- The minimal viable pipeline decomposition (parsing → reasoning → verification → explanation) given your functional requirements.\\n\\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\\n- A practical system will likely combine a large transformer‑based model (for language understanding and chain‑of‑thought) with task‑specific symbolic or programmatic modules (for deterministic calculation, rule application, or verification).\\n- Common, high‑impact datasets to start prototyping: GSM8K (grade‑school math), MATH, MMLU, BIG‑Bench tasks relevant to reasoning, ARC, and HumanEval for programmatic outputs.\\n- Effective techniques to improve multi‑step reasoning early on: chain‑of‑thought prompting, few‑shot examples, self‑consistency sampling, and fine‑tuning on generated CoT annotations if you have labeled data.\\n- For parsing problems into executable forms, a seq2seq model that outputs a constrained DSL or executable Python (with strong validation/sandboxing) is a pragmatic approach; semantic parsing literature and program synthesis techniques will be directly relevant.\\n- For tooling and rapid iteration: Python + PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers/Hub, LangChain (for orchestration and retrieval), and use of open models for prototyping to avoid API cost.\\n- Prototype compute needs: you can experiment with small/medium models on a single GPU (e.g., 16–40 GB); fine‑tuning larger LLMs or training from scratch will require multi‑GPU/TPU setups and substantially higher cost.\\n- Typical evaluation: automatic accuracy on benchmark tasks plus a human evaluation loop for correctness, robustness, and quality of explanations; incorporate adversarial and edge‑case tests early.\\n- Likely development path: start with prompting and retrieval‑augmentation on an off‑the‑shelf LLM to validate task decomposition, then add fine‑tuning / modular symbolic components as needs for correctness and efficiency grow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\n- Clarify objectives and constraints (generator): gather target task types (math, commonsense, code), latency/budget/privacy requirements, and success metrics so the team has a concrete scope before building.\\n\\n- Inventory datasets and benchmarks (coder + generator): coder pulls candidate datasets (GSM8K, MATH, MMLU, domain-specific corpora) and sample problem formats; generator prioritizes which benchmarks matter for initial MVP.\\n\\n- Prototype reasoning-first baseline (coder): implement few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting against an off-the-shelf LLM (or open model) to validate capability without heavy engineering.\\n\\n- Prototype parsing-first baseline (coder): build a simple seq2seq semantic parser that maps problems to a constrained DSL or executable Python snippets, with sandboxed execution for verification.\\n\\n- Implement verification layer (verifier + coder): verifier defines correctness checks and edge-case tests; coder implements symbolic/unit-test based validators that run on parser outputs and LLM solutions (consistency checks, numeric equivalence).\\n\\n- Define and run evaluation suite (verifier): evaluate prototypes on automatic metrics (accuracy, execution success, F1 for parse quality) and a small human-eval sample for explanation quality and failure modes.\\n\\n- Iterate on hybrid pipeline (coder + verifier): combine LLM reasoning with programmatic parsing/verification—use LLM for parsing when uncertain, and deterministic modules for arithmetic or logical steps; verifier measures improvement and flags regressions.\\n\\n- Instrument explainability and traceability (coder + generator): coder logs parse trees, chain-of-thought traces, and verification results; generator drafts user-facing explanations and formats for outputs.\\n\\n- Plan data augmentation and fine-tuning (generator + coder): generator identifies annotation needs and templates for CoT/parse supervision; coder scripts synthetic data generation and small-scale fine-tuning experiments.\\n\\n- Decide deployment approach and next milestones (generator + verifier): generator recommends prototype vs production path (API vs local), and verifier sets acceptance criteria for launching an alpha; schedule iterative sprints based on those criteria.\\n\"}], 'author_name': 'magentic_manager', 'additional_properties': {}}\n",

Send the questionnaire to the relevant stakeholders, get the answers, then use the action plans to start the project.\\n\\nQUESTIONNAIRE (please answer each item as fully as possible)\\n1) Target problem types and domains\\n- Which problem types should the system handle? (pick any: math word problems, logical puzzles, code generation, commonsense reasoning, table lookup, information extraction, etc.)\\n- For each chosen type, provide 3 representative example inputs and the exact desired outputs (include any preferred output format, e.g., “final numeric answer”, “annotated steps”, “executable code”). For each example state whether intermediate reasoning steps should be returned (e.g., chain‑of‑thought) or hidden.\\n  - Example format to copy for each example:\\n    - Input: \"...\"\\n    - Desired output: \"...\"\\n    - Return reasoning? Yes/No\\n- Priority across types: rank the chosen types 1 (highest)–N.\\n\\n2) Success metrics and targets\\n- Which automatic metrics matter? (examples: exact-match accuracy on benchmark X, token-level BLEU, pass@k for code, F1 for extraction, % correctness)\\n- Quantitative targets for each metric (e.g., “>= 75% exact-match on small dev set”, “latency <= 2s p50”).\\n- Latency and throughput requirements: max acceptable p95 latency, required concurrent throughput (requests/sec), required SLA (% uptime).\\n\\n3) Deployment / operational constraints\\n- Budget for API or infrastructure per month (range is fine).\\n- Privacy/data‑residency constraints (e.g., no PII leave our network, EU data must remain in EU, HIPAA, etc.).\\n- Allowed external APIs/services (yes/no) and any blacklisted integrations.\\n- Availability/constraints on deploying models (cloud only, on‑prem only, must use vendor X).\\n\\n4) Available data and annotation resources\\n- Existing datasets (names, sizes, formats — e.g., CSV of 10k Q/A pairs, repositories of problem statements, logs).\\n- Do you have human-labeled chain‑of‑thought (CoT) or NL→program pairs? If yes, how many and in which format?\\n- Labeling resources: internal annotators or access to crowd workers, available monthly labeling budget, expected time per label.\\n\\n5) Preferred model approach constraints\\n- Preference: closed commercial API (hosted) vs open models self-hosted vs hybrid.\\n- Fine-tuning allowed? (yes/no) If yes, which types (parameter‑efficient tuning, instruction‑tuning, full fine‑tune)?\\n- Compute availability: GPUs (type/quantity), CPUs, memory, and storage available for experiments and for production.\\n- Any cost constraints on model size or requests per second?\\n\\n6) Timeline and priority\\n- Target prototype timeline (e.g., prototype in 2–4 weeks?) and production timeline (e.g., 3 months).\\n- Is rapid demo a higher priority than production robustness? (Yes/No)\\n- Which features must ship in MVP vs can wait for later?\\n\\n7) Safety, interpretability, and regulatory constraints\\n- Explainability requirements (must always show reasoning, or only final answer).\\n- Audit/logging requirements (store prompts/responses, redaction needed, retention period).\\n- Regulatory constraints (GDPR data subject rights, industry-specific rules).\\n- Failure-mode handling: allowed to answer “I don’t know”, must escalate to human, etc.\\n\\nOptional: Additional context\\n- Key stakeholders and reviewers, sample users, and examples of unacceptable outputs.\\n\\nPRIORITIZED MVP (one paragraph)\\nBuild a focused MVP that supports one high‑priority problem type (pick the top‑ranked from your questionnaire) with a narrow input/output schema and deterministic postprocessing. For example, if the priority is math word problems, the MVP will accept plain English problem statements and return a concise numeric answer plus a short structured proof (optional). Target one standard benchmark for comparability (e.g., GSM8K for grade‑school math, HumanEval or MBPP for code generation, a curated 500‑example in‑house dev set for domain tasks). Minimum acceptance criteria: a development set accuracy of at least 60–80% (choose target per task difficulty), p95 inference latency under your stated limit (typical dev target: <2s via API or <500ms for cached/local microservice), and reproducible verification tests (automated checks pass on >=90% of held-out evaluation examples). Keep scope tight: support one input format, one output format, and one model/approach initially (e.g., API-based best-in-class LLM with prompt engineering) and defer fine-tuning or multi-model orchestration to next phase.\\n\\nIMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN — CODER (tasks, required resources, estimated time)\\n1) Data inventory and minimal canonical dataset (1–2 days)\\n- Task: Gather and format 200–500 representative examples across the chosen task into a canonical JSONL with fields {id, input, expected_output, reasoning_allowed:Boolean}.\\n- Resources: developer laptop/VM, text editor, ~2–4 hours of stakeholder interviews to collect examples.\\n- Output: canonical dev set (200–500 examples) and 50 example “hard negatives” if available.\\n\\n2) Quick prompting experiments (2–5 days)\\n- Task: Run iterative prompt‑engineering experiments against the chosen model class (closed API or open local). Start with zero‑shot, few‑shot (3–10 exemplars), CoT vs. answer‑only prompts, and simple output‑formatting instructions.\\n- Sample sizes: 200–500 dev examples; run 3–5 prompt variants (so ~1k–2.5k requests).\\n- Resources: API access or local inference nodes; if using API, reserve $200–$1,000 credits for experiments depending on model and number of runs; laptop/VM for scripting.\\n- Estimated time: 2–3 full workdays for setup and 1–2 days for a round of experiments/analysis.\\n- Output: ranked prompt templates, performance table (accuracy, examples of failures), recommended prompt for MVP.\\n\\n3) Lightweight semantic‑DSL parser prototype (5–10 days)\\n- Task: If outputs must be executable (programs, calculations, or structured logic), implement a small semantic DSL and a parser that maps LLM outputs to the DSL; include a validator and executor. Keep DSL minimal (e.g., arithmetic operators, loops/conditionals if needed, or a small AST for code generation).\\n- Implementation notes: Use Python; implement parser with a simple PEG/regex-based validator or an existing parsing library; include unit tests and sample executions.\\n- Resources: developer workstation, ~1–2 GB storage for code and test data.\\n- Sample sizes: 200 labeled pairs (NL→DSL or NL→program) to validate mapping; can be synthetic for early stages.\\n- Estimated time: 5–10 days for a minimally robust prototype (shorter if DSL is extremely small).\\n\\n4) (Optional) Small fine‑tuning / RCT (2–3 weeks)\\n- Task: If allowed and justified by prompt experiments, run a parameter‑efficient fine‑tune (LoRA or instruction tuning) on ~1k–5k examples.\\n- Compute: single GPU (A10 / T4 / 16‑32GB VRAM) for LoRA-style tuning; larger GPU for full fine-tune.\\n- Estimated time: 1–2 days for setup, 1–7 days for training depending on examples and compute.\\n- Note: Do this only after validating that prompts alone do not meet acceptance criteria.\\n\\nDeliverables for coder by end of prototype: canonical dataset, best prompt(s) and performance table, working DSL parser prototype with tests, and recommendation whether to fine-tune.\\n\\nIMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN — VERIFIER (tasks, required resources, estimated time)\\n1) Define evaluation metrics and automated checks (0.5–1 day)\\n- Task: Translate stakeholder success metrics into concrete tests:\\n  - Correctness: exact‑match, normalized numeric equality, or functional tests (for code: run unit tests).\\n  - Robustness: adversarial paraphrase checks.\\n  - Latency: p50/p95 measured under expected concurrency.\\n  - Safety: banned-phrases/PII redaction checks.\\n- Output: evaluation spec document listing each metric, pass thresholds, and measurement method.\\n\\n2) Design human evaluation suite (2–4 days)\\n- Task: Create 50–200 human evaluation examples that cover easy/typical/hard/edge cases. For each example, provide guidelines for human raters and an answer rubric (scoring 0–2 or 0–3).\\n- Sample sizing guidance:\\n  - Pilot: 50 examples, 3 raters each to estimate inter-annotator agreement.\\n  - Full: 200 examples, 3 raters each for stable estimates.\\n- Resources: internal annotators or crowd workers (estimate cost: a few USD per label depending on complexity). Time: design and test: 1–2 days; annotation round: dependent on workforce (few hours to 2 days).\\n- Output: human evaluation dataset and scoring rubric.\\n\\n3) Draft verification checks for parsing/execution (1–3 days)\\n- Task: For outputs that map to the DSL or to executable code:\\n  - Syntax validation: ensure parser accepts output into canonical AST; fail anything else.\\n  - Type/semantic checks: ensure variables/operations are valid (e.g., no divide by zero).\\n  - Deterministic execution tests: run on small synthetic test cases and compare expected outputs.\\n  - Safety checks: sandbox execution (no network/file access), resource/time limits.\\n- Resources: sandboxed execution environment (e.g., subprocess with timeouts or a container), unit test harness.\\n- Estimated time: 1–3 days to write checks and integrate into CI.\\n\\n4) Reporting and acceptance gating (0.5–1 day)\\n- Task: Define the gating rules for promoting to the next stage (e.g., “must pass automated tests at 90% and human eval >= target”).\\n- Output: acceptance checklist and release criteria.\\n\\nSUMMARY TIMELINE (example for 2–4 week prototype)\\n- Day 0–2: Send questionnaire; collect canonical examples; data inventory.\\n- Day 2–7: Prompting experiments + initial performance analysis.\\n- Day 5–12: DSL parser prototype + unit tests (overlapping with experiments).\\n- Day 8–14: Design human eval and automated verification checks; run pilot annotations.\\n- Optional Day 12–21: Fine-tuning experiments if needed.\\n- Deliverables at end of prototype: working demo, evaluation report, recommended next steps toward production.\\n\\nQuick practical recommendations\\n- Keep MVP single‑domain and single‑format. The simplest success case (e.g., numeric answers with a small proof or code functions with unit tests) gives the highest chance to meet targets quickly.\\n- Start with prompt engineering and structured output enforcement before costly fine‑tuning.\\n- Sandbox any execution and log prompts/responses for auditing, subject to privacy constraints.\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Convert the questionnaire into a fillable form (CSV/Google Form) or\\n- Draft the initial prompt templates and a minimal DSL grammar for the specific problem type you choose.\\n\\nWhich problem type should I assume for the initial prompt templates and DSL example? Provide your answers to the questionnaire (or the top 1–2 items) and I’ll generate the concrete prompts, a starter DSL grammar, and a test harness.'}], 'author_name': 'GeneratorAgent', 'additional_properties': {}}\n",

If fewer provided, pad with auto-generated examples as instructed in the summary.\\n  2) Run prompt experiments: zero-shot, few-shot (3–10 exemplars), CoT vs answer-only, output-format enforcement. Use 200 dev examples for initial evaluation and 3–5 prompt variants. Produce performance table (accuracy, representative successes/failures).\\n  3) Implement minimal semantic DSL parser prototype (Python). Keep grammar minimal; include syntax validator and executor sandbox.\\n- Deliverables:\\n  - canonical_dev.jsonl in /project/mvp_inputs/\\n  - report: prompt variants + performance table\\n  - DSL prototype repository link and unit tests\\n- Start: within 48 hours of summary delivery\\n- Progress check: 7 days after start\\n- Estimate: 2 weeks for prototype\\nOwner: [coder name]\\nPriority: High\\n\\nTicket B — Verifier: evaluation spec + human-eval pilot\\nTitle: MVP Verifier — define evaluation metrics and run 50-sample human-eval pilot\\nDescription:\\n- Tasks:\\n  1) Translate stakeholder success metrics into concrete automated tests (exact-match rules, numeric normalization, unit tests for code, p50/p95 latency measurement).\\n  2) Design a 50-sample human evaluation pilot covering easy/typical/hard/edge cases.

This is a simulation to exercise the experiment pipeline; real model runs must replace the solver with API/hosted model calls.\\n- Metrics (from project/mvp_outputs/experiment_results.json):\\n  - All variants (simulated) achieved 100.00% accuracy on 200 examples (expected because the local solver computes exact answers).\\n  - Latency (measured locally for solver) is negligible; p50 and p95 approximately 0.00 ms at this resolution (solver is in-process).\\n  - Estimated cost (simulated): ~$0.06 per variant (the harness used a placeholder cost_per_call; adjust to real API pricing when running real experiments).\\n  - Representative successes: examples are arithmetic problems such as \"Compute 82 + 15.\" -> 97.\\n  - Representative failures: none in the simulated run (but real models will produce errors).\\n\\nNotes about the simulated experiments\\n- The current experiment harness is a working pipeline for running prompt variants and collecting accuracy/latency/cost and representative examples. To run real evaluations you need to:\\n  - Replace the deterministic solver in scripts/prompt_experiments.py with actual model calls (OpenAI/Anthropic/your hosted endpoint).\\n  - Add proper batching, retries, token counting (for cost), and concurrency to measure realistic latency (p50/p95).\\n  - Provide API credentials or start a self-hosted model (one GPU with 16–32GB VRAM recommended for medium-sized LLMs).\\n  - Reserve API credits (I recommended $200–$1,000 depending on model size/price and number of calls). The code has a simple cost_per_call placeholder.\\n\\nDSL prototype (semantic DSL)\\n- Implemented a minimal DSL in project/dsl/simple_dsl.py:\\n  - Supports integer arithmetic, parentheses, and assignments, e.g.:\\n    - \"x = 3 + 2; x * 4\" -> returns [5, 20]\\n  - Parser (tokenizer + recursive descent) and sandboxed executor (no external imports; only integer ops).\\n  - Unit tests present (runable via scripts/run_dsl_tests.py). Tests passed in this environment.\\n- The DSL is intentionally small to keep validation/sandboxing simple. It demonstrates how executable outputs could be parsed and safely executed.\\n\\nValidation / fixes applied\\n- merge_and_validate.py:\\n  - Normalizes records to fields: id, input, output, source.\\n  - Drops entries with empty input or output.\\n  - Outputs project/mvp_inputs/all_mvp_responses.jsonl\\n- generate_summary_and_canonical.py:\\n  - Produces mvp_summary.md and canonical_dev.jsonl, padding to 200 examples by duplicating entries (with new ids) when needed.\\n\\nHuman-eval pilot\\n- Selected first 50 examples from canonical_dev.jsonl and wrote them to:\\n  - project/mvp_outputs/human_eval_pilot_50.jsonl\\n- evaluation_spec.md created under project root describing task and metrics to confirm with verifier.\\n\\nCommit & repo artifacts\\n- COMMIT_LOG.txt lists all created/updated files.\\n- prototype_status_report.json contains the script outputs and file paths.\\n\\nBlockers / actions required to continue\\n1. Real model access:\\n   - Need API keys or a hosted model endpoint to run the prompt experiments on a real model.\\n   - If using hosted model: reserve $200–$1,000 credits as requested (depends on model/number of calls).\\n   - If self-hosting: provision 1 GPU (16–32GB VRAM) and deploy the chosen model.\\n2. Prompt tuning & exemplar selection:\\n   - The current few-shot harness samples exemplars randomly. We should design exemplar selection strategies (diversity, difficulty) for better experiments.\\n3. Dataset coverage:\\n   - The current data is arithmetic-only (created as fallback). If the real MVP task is broader, please provide stakeholder replies or a seed file with target task examples.\\n4. Human evaluation setup:\\n   - Need final evaluation_spec.md confirmation from verifier.\\n   - Need human evaluators or a platform to collect judgements (instructions, UI, consent, quality controls).\\n\\nNext steps I propose (can start immediately once you confirm)\\n- Confirm evaluation_spec.md with the verifier. I created a draft; we should incorporate any required fields.\\n- If you have stakeholder replies, please drop them into project/mvp_inputs/replies/ as JSON files (list or single objects). The next run of merge_and_validate.py will incorporate them.\\n- Configure prompt_experiments.py to call your chosen model:\\n  - Add API call logic, concurrency, token counting, cost model, and error handling.\\n  - Run the experiments with ~200 dev examples and 3–5 prompt variants as requested.\\n- Run human eval pilot (50 samples) to sanity-check the evaluation spec and interface.\\n- Integrate the DSL into model outputs validation: define expected DSL outputs and use dsl/simple_dsl.py to parse & execute safely.\\n\\nPlanned schedule & coordination\\n- I created a schedule note and set a first progress check in 7 days from the prototype run.\\n- I will coordinate with the verifier to confirm evaluation_spec.md and provide the 50-sample pilot candidates (already created).\\n- Once you provide model access/credentials or confirm self-hosting, I will run the real prompt experiments, collect metrics (accuracy, p50/p95 latency, cost), and post results to the project channel.\\n\\nHow to reproduce or continue locally\\n- From the repo root:\\n  - python3 scripts/merge_and_validate.py\\n  - python3 scripts/generate_summary_and_canonical.py\\n  - python3 scripts/prompt_experiments.py   # (currently simulated; replace solver with real model calls)\\n  - python3 scripts/run_dsl_tests.py\\n- Files are under /mnt/data/project as linked above.\\n\\nStatus report (concise)\\n- canonical_dev.jsonl: created (200 examples; padded from fallback)\\n- initial prompt results: simulated experiments complete; results at project/mvp_outputs/experiment_results.json\\n- blockers: need model access or GPU + model binary to run real prompt experiments; need stakeholder replies if available to replace fallback.\\n- Next checkpoint: schedule first progress check in 7 days. I will report to the project channel once canonical_dev.jsonl and initial real-model prompt results are available.\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Immediately modify prompt_experiments.py to call a specific API (OpenAI, Anthropic, or a local endpoint) — I will need API credentials / endpoint and any rate/price constraints.\\n- Replace the fallback dataset with stakeholder replies if you paste them here or upload files (I will place them into project/mvp_inputs/replies/ and re-run merge/generate).\\n- Expand the DSL grammar to handle a couple more constructs (booleans, if/then, simple functions) and add more unit tests.\\n\\nWhich of these would you like me to do next?\\n- (A) Wire experiments to a hosted API now (please provide API credentials and preferred model class + cost cap), or\\n- (B) Prepare the repo for you to run locally by adding instructions and a small config file where you fill in secrets, or\\n- (C) Replace the fallback with stakeholder replies you provide and re-run the merge/validate/generate steps.\\n\\nIf you want me to proceed with any of the above, tell me which option and provide the required inputs (e.g., stakeholder replies or API credentials/config info).'}], 'author_name': 'CoderAgent', 'additional_properties': {}}\n",

Please paste the contents of evaluation_spec.md and project/mvp_outputs/human_eval_pilot_50.jsonl (or attach them). Once I have them I will (within 48 hours) either: (a) produce finalized evaluation_spec.md and the human-eval rubric/JSONL-approved markups, or (b) mark “approved as-is” if they already meet the acceptance gates below.\\n- Meanwhile, below I provide a concrete, fully-specified recommended evaluation spec, numeric thresholds, rubric, labeling logistics, sandboxing/safety checks, automated harness checks, and a go/no-go gate. Treat these as the default changes I will apply to evaluation_spec.md unless you instruct otherwise or the files contain conflicting constraints.\\n\\n1) Automatic metrics and numeric thresholds (concrete numbers)\\n- Overall approach: report per-task-type metrics and an aggregate. Separate task types: closed-answer classification/QA, numeric-output tasks, code-generation, open-ended generation (summaries, instructions).\\n- Closed-answer exact-match (deterministic short answers)\\n  - Metric: exact-match % after normalization (trim whitespace, case fold, strip punctuation where appropriate).\\n  - Prototype → next-stage gate: >= 85%\\n  - Production gate: >= 95%\\n- Normalized numeric equality (numerical outputs)\\n  - Metric: pass if |pred - gold| <= max(absolute_tol, relative_tol * |gold|)\\n  - Default tolerances: absolute_tol = 1e-6; relative_tol = 1e-3 (use relative_tol for |gold| >= 1e-3)\\n  - Gate: >= 95% on numeric tasks\\n- Code generation (unit-tests-based)\\n  - Metric: unit-test pass rate computed by executing generated programs with harness tests. Report pass@1, pass@5, pass@10 (see below).\\n  - Estimation / sampling: for N completions per problem, use standard pass@k estimator (compute empirical pass@k or use standard closed-form estimator for sampling without replacement when applicable). Include sample size per problem (recommended: generate 200 completions per prompt to estimate pass@k robustly if you must estimate pass@1/pass@k statistically).\\n  - Prototype → next-stage gates:\\n    - pass@1 >= 40%\\n    - pass@5 >= 60%\\n    - pass@10 >= 70%\\n    - unit-test average pass-rate across tasks >= 50%\\n  - Production gates (if moving to production): pass@1 >= 60%, pass@10 >= 85%\\n- Open-ended generation (QA with long-form, summarization, instructions)\\n  - Metrics: human-rated correctness/utility (see rubric), plus automated overlap metrics (ROUGE-L, BERTScore) for monitoring only — do not gate on these alone.\\n  - Prototype gate: human-eval mean correctness >= 0.75 (on 0/0.5/1 scale described below)\\n- Latency (API/endpoint)\\n  - Metrics: p50 and p95 end-to-end response latency (including network, model runtime, postprocessing).\\n  - Recommended MVP targets for interactive use:\\n    - p50 <= 500 ms\\n    - p95 <= 2000 ms\\n  - If offline/batch tasks: specify separate batch latency SLA (e.g., 95% of batch jobs complete within target window).\\n- Robustness / stability metrics to report\\n  - Deterministic equivalence: fraction of identical outputs across 3 repeated runs with same seed/temperature when determinism is required.\\n  - Resource usage: GPU memory and peak CPU time per request (for cost modelling).\\n- Failure-mode metrics\\n  - Rate of safety violations (see section 4). Gate: 0 safety-critical violations allowed for production; prototype may have 0 allowed within sandboxed tests.\\n- Statistical significance & sample sizes\\n  - For single-run experiments report 95% confidence intervals for main metrics (bootstrap). For pass@k metrics computed from sampling follow standard variance estimation.\\n\\n2) Human-eval 50-sample pilot and annotation rubric\\n- I cannot view your current human_eval_pilot_50.jsonl. Please paste or attach. Below is the recommended pilot design and rubric I will apply unless you want different coverage.\\n\\nRecommended 50-sample pilot composition (if you want different coverage, tell me which categories to replace)\\n- 20 code-generation tasks (mix of algorithmic, string/IO, small library usage)\\n- 15 reasoning/math tasks (multi-step arithmetic, logic puzzles)\\n- 10 closed-answer QA tasks (factual, short answers)\\n- 5 safety / instruction-following tasks (sensitive prompts, PII, hallucination-prone)\\nIf the existing 50 differ, provide current category Breakdown and I will advise replacements so coverage is balanced.\\n\\nHuman annotation rubric (final: include text in evaluation_spec.md and as an annotation guideline)\\n- Use a 3-point scoring scale:\\n  - 1.0 = Correct (fully correct, no substantive errors)\\n    - Closed-answer: exact match under normalization.\\n    - Numeric: within numeric tolerance (see numeric equality rule).\\n    - Code: passes all unit tests in harness without modifications.\\n    - Open-ended: answer contains correct factual content and necessary reasoning steps. No critical errors.\\n  - 0.5 = Partially correct (substantial correct content but with notable deficiency)\\n    - Closed-answer: answers correct but missing required format or off by minor but meaningful detail.\\n    - Numeric: within 5% (or a secondary relaxed tolerance) but not primary tolerance.\\n    - Code: compiles/runs but fails some nontrivial tests or has a simple fix; reviewer judges solution shows correct approach.\\n    - Open-ended: correct approach and mostly correct content, but missing final conclusion or has small mistakes.\\n  - 0.0 = Incorrect (wrong, unsafe, or non-responsive)\\n    - Closed-answer: incorrect or empty.\\n    - Numeric: outside relaxed tolerance.\\n    - Code: does not compile, throws exceptions, or output is unrelated.\\n    - Open-ended: wrong reasoning, hallucinations, or harmful instructions.\\n- Annotation instructions and examples\\n  - Supply 4–6 example annotated items per task type to train annotators (include borderline partial-credit examples).\\n  - For code tasks: the primary signal is unit-test pass; human annotator only marks partial credit when code demonstrates correct algorithmic approach but has failing edge-case tests.\\n  - On ambiguous cases, annotators should mark “0.5” and write a short note describing the deficiency; an adjudicator will resolve ties.\\n- Aggregation rule\\n  - Use average score across raters for final per-example score. For binary decisions (pass/fail) convert 1.0 => pass, 0.5 => partial, 0.0 => fail. Use majority for pass/fail thresholds when required.\\n- Accept/reject thresholds for pilot metrics\\n  - Mean human-eval correctness (average across samples and raters) prototype → next-stage gate: >= 0.75\\n  - For stricter promotion: >= 0.8\\n\\n3) Labeling logistics: raters, agreement, platform, cost/time\\n- Raters per example\\n  - Minimum: 3 independent raters per example.\\n  - For high-variance tasks (open-ended or safety), use 5 raters (optional).\\n- Inter-annotator agreement\\n  - Target agreement: Krippendorff’s alpha >= 0.67 (substantial) OR Cohen’s kappa >= 0.6 for pairwise. If alpha < 0.6, perform adjudication and/or increase raters per item.\\n- Adjudication flow\\n  - If three raters have no majority (e.g., 1/1/1 across 3 classes), route to an expert adjudicator (1 person) who decides final label.\\n- Platform\\n  - For a 50-sample pilot: recommend internal annotators / small trusted crowd to ensure quality. Rationale: small sample, need for calibration and domain expertise.\\n  - For larger-scale evaluation: use an established crowd platform (e.g., internal labeling platform or professional vendor). Require qualification tests and qualification passing script with sample annotation tasks and gold labels.\\n- Budget and time estimates (50-sample pilot, 3 raters)\\n  - Workload: 50 samples × 3 raters = 150 annotations.\\n  - Time per annotation: 3–7 minutes depending on task complexity (for code may be 7–15 min if running tests and reading).\\n  - Total annotation time (person-hours): estimate 7.5–18.75 hours.\\n  - Cost estimates:\\n    - If using internal annotators (hourly): 7.5–18.75 hours × internal rate.\\n    - If using crowd and paying per annotation: pay $1.50–$6 per annotation depending on complexity. Example midpoint $3 × 150 = $450. For high-quality code assessments, higher pay is expected (e.g., $8–$15 per annotation).\\n  - Turnaround:\\n    - Internal: 1–3 business days to recruit/assign and complete.\\n    - Crowd: 2–5 business days including qualification.\\n- QA for annotators\\n  - Qualification quiz (10 gold items) with minimum pass rate 80%.\\n  - Embed gold items within the batch (5–10% gold rate) to monitor ongoing quality.\\n\\n4) Safety / PII checks and sandboxing requirements\\n- Safety / PII\\n  - Automated PII detection: run all outputs through a PII classifier (names, SSNs, credit card patterns, phone numbers, emails, addresses). Any positive detection must flag the example for manual review; for promotion to production, the final system must report PII rate = 0 for allowed prompts.\\n  - Prompt-safety checks: detect attempts to coax the model to reveal training data, personal data, or to execute unsafe instructions.\\n  - Policy gate: Critical: any output that includes user-identifiable PII or clearly disallowed content => fail; do not permit in production.\\n- Sandboxing for code execution (harmless but necessary)\\n  - Execution environment requirements:\\n    - Containerized ephemeral runtime per example (e.g., ephemeral Docker / microVM).\\n    - No network access (disable outbound/inbound).\\n    - No persistent mounts to host FS; only ephemeral in-container FS that will be destroyed after run.\\n    - CPU/memory limits (for example, 2 CPU, 2GB RAM per run) and hard timeouts (e.g., 30s per test case, 60s total per example).\\n    - Disable subprocess/fork privileges, and limit syscalls where possible (seccomp policies).\\n    - Capture stdout/stderr and process exit code.\\n  - Static and dynamic checks:\\n    - Static analyze generated source for forbidden APIs (os.system, subprocess, socket, open with absolute paths, eval/exec, reflection code). If present, mark as unsafe and do not execute; return to human review.\\n    - Dynamic runtime instrumentation to detect network calls, excessive file writes, or spawn of processes — terminate and flag as violation.\\n  - Logging:\\n    - Log execution outputs and resource usage to reproduce results offline; redact any PII before storing logs centrally.\\n- Forbidden operations for DSL/execution\\n  - No network operations\\n  - No direct system-level calls (system, popen) other than allowed safe stdlib for the task\\n  - No access to host metadata (e.g., host files, credentials)\\n  - No calls to external databases/APIs\\n- Safety test harness additions\\n  - Add a set of adversarial prompts and red-team test cases. Gate: system must not produce harmful content in these cases.\\n  - For code: include tests that attempt to exfiltrate secrets or call network — harness must flag these and ensure the sandbox blocks them.\\n\\n5) Additional automated verification checks to add to the harness\\n- Numeric tolerance helper (implement configurable absolute + relative tolerance).\\n- Unit-test harness:\\n  - Deterministically run testcases with fixed random seeds where applicable.\\n  - Fail example if runtime exceptions occur (for code tasks).\\n  - Capture flaky tests and rerun up to 2 times to reduce noise; note flakiness separately.\\n- Output normalization utilities:\\n  - Case-insensitive normalize, strip punctuation, normalize Unicode, canonicalize numeric formats.\\n- Forbidden token detection:\\n  - Detect and flag generation of any blacklisted tokens/commands (e.g., \"ssh \", \"curl \", \"rm -rf\", secrets patterns).\\n- Plagiarism/check for training data leakage:\\n  - For sensitive tasks, run simple n-gram overlap against known reference corpora if available.

Please paste or attach. Below is the recommended pilot design and rubric I will apply unless you want different coverage.\\n\\nRecommended 50-sample pilot composition (if you want different coverage, tell me which categories to replace)\\n- 20 code-generation tasks (mix of algorithmic, string/IO, small library usage)\\n- 15 reasoning/math tasks (multi-step arithmetic, logic puzzles)\\n- 10 closed-answer QA tasks (factual, short answers)\\n- 5 safety / instruction-following tasks (sensitive prompts, PII, hallucination-prone)\\nIf the existing 50 differ, provide current category Breakdown and I will advise replacements so coverage is balanced.\\n\\nHuman annotation rubric (final: include text in evaluation_spec.md and as an annotation guideline)\\n- Use a 3-point scoring scale:\\n  - 1.0 = Correct (fully correct, no substantive errors)\\n    - Closed-answer: exact match under normalization.\\n    - Numeric: within numeric tolerance (see numeric equality rule).\\n    - Code: passes all unit tests in harness without modifications.\\n    - Open-ended: answer contains correct factual content and necessary reasoning steps. No critical errors.\\n  - 0.5 = Partially correct (substantial correct content but with notable deficiency)\\n    - Closed-answer: answers correct but missing required format or off by minor but meaningful detail.\\n    - Numeric: within 5% (or a secondary relaxed tolerance) but not primary tolerance.\\n    - Code: compiles/runs but fails some nontrivial tests or has a simple fix; reviewer judges solution shows correct approach.\\n    - Open-ended: correct approach and mostly correct content, but missing final conclusion or has small mistakes.\\n  - 0.0 = Incorrect (wrong, unsafe, or non-responsive)\\n    - Closed-answer: incorrect or empty.\\n    - Numeric: outside relaxed tolerance.\\n    - Code: does not compile, throws exceptions, or output is unrelated.\\n    - Open-ended: wrong reasoning, hallucinations, or harmful instructions.\\n- Annotation instructions and examples\\n  - Supply 4–6 example annotated items per task type to train annotators (include borderline partial-credit examples).\\n  - For code tasks: the primary signal is unit-test pass; human annotator only marks partial credit when code demonstrates correct algorithmic approach but has failing edge-case tests.\\n  - On ambiguous cases, annotators should mark “0.5” and write a short note describing the deficiency; an adjudicator will resolve ties.\\n- Aggregation rule\\n  - Use average score across raters for final per-example score. For binary decisions (pass/fail) convert 1.0 => pass, 0.5 => partial, 0.0 => fail. Use majority for pass/fail thresholds when required.\\n- Accept/reject thresholds for pilot metrics\\n  - Mean human-eval correctness (average across samples and raters) prototype → next-stage gate: >= 0.75\\n  - For stricter promotion: >= 0.8\\n\\n3) Labeling logistics: raters, agreement, platform, cost/time\\n- Raters per example\\n  - Minimum: 3 independent raters per example.\\n  - For high-variance tasks (open-ended or safety), use 5 raters (optional).\\n- Inter-annotator agreement\\n  - Target agreement: Krippendorff’s alpha >= 0.67 (substantial) OR Cohen’s kappa >= 0.6 for pairwise. If alpha < 0.6, perform adjudication and/or increase raters per item.\\n- Adjudication flow\\n  - If three raters have no majority (e.g., 1/1/1 across 3 classes), route to an expert adjudicator (1 person) who decides final label.\\n- Platform\\n  - For a 50-sample pilot: recommend internal annotators / small trusted crowd to ensure quality. Rationale: small sample, need for calibration and domain expertise.\\n  - For larger-scale evaluation: use an established crowd platform (e.g., internal labeling platform or professional vendor). Require qualification tests and qualification passing script with sample annotation tasks and gold labels.\\n- Budget and time estimates (50-sample pilot, 3 raters)\\n  - Workload: 50 samples × 3 raters = 150 annotations.\\n  - Time per annotation: 3–7 minutes depending on task complexity (for code may be 7–15 min if running tests and reading).\\n  - Total annotation time (person-hours): estimate 7.5–18.75 hours.\\n  - Cost estimates:\\n    - If using internal annotators (hourly): 7.5–18.75 hours × internal rate.\\n    - If using crowd and paying per annotation: pay $1.50–$6 per annotation depending on complexity. Example midpoint $3 × 150 = $450. For high-quality code assessments, higher pay is expected (e.g., $8–$15 per annotation).\\n  - Turnaround:\\n    - Internal: 1–3 business days to recruit/assign and complete.\\n    - Crowd: 2–5 business days including qualification.\\n- QA for annotators\\n  - Qualification quiz (10 gold items) with minimum pass rate 80%.\\n  - Embed gold items within the batch (5–10% gold rate) to monitor ongoing quality.\\n\\n4) Safety / PII checks and sandboxing requirements\\n- Safety / PII\\n  - Automated PII detection: run all outputs through a PII classifier (names, SSNs, credit card patterns, phone numbers, emails, addresses). Any positive detection must flag the example for manual review; for promotion to production, the final system must report PII rate = 0 for allowed prompts.\\n  - Prompt-safety checks: detect attempts to coax the model to reveal training data, personal data, or to execute unsafe instructions.\\n  - Policy gate: Critical: any output that includes user-identifiable PII or clearly disallowed content => fail; do not permit in production.\\n- Sandboxing for code execution (harmless but necessary)\\n  - Execution environment requirements:\\n    - Containerized ephemeral runtime per example (e.g., ephemeral Docker / microVM).\\n    - No network access (disable outbound/inbound).\\n    - No persistent mounts to host FS; only ephemeral in-container FS that will be destroyed after run.\\n    - CPU/memory limits (for example, 2 CPU, 2GB RAM per run) and hard timeouts (e.g., 30s per test case, 60s total per example).\\n    - Disable subprocess/fork privileges, and limit syscalls where possible (seccomp policies).\\n    - Capture stdout/stderr and process exit code.\\n  - Static and dynamic checks:\\n    - Static analyze generated source for forbidden APIs (os.system, subprocess, socket, open with absolute paths, eval/exec, reflection code). If present, mark as unsafe and do not execute; return to human review.\\n    - Dynamic runtime instrumentation to detect network calls, excessive file writes, or spawn of processes — terminate and flag as violation.\\n  - Logging:\\n    - Log execution outputs and resource usage to reproduce results offline; redact any PII before storing logs centrally.\\n- Forbidden operations for DSL/execution\\n  - No network operations\\n  - No direct system-level calls (system, popen) other than allowed safe stdlib for the task\\n  - No access to host metadata (e.g., host files, credentials)\\n  - No calls to external databases/APIs\\n- Safety test harness additions\\n  - Add a set of adversarial prompts and red-team test cases. Gate: system must not produce harmful content in these cases.\\n  - For code: include tests that attempt to exfiltrate secrets or call network — harness must flag these and ensure the sandbox blocks them.\\n\\n5) Additional automated verification checks to add to the harness\\n- Numeric tolerance helper (implement configurable absolute + relative tolerance).\\n- Unit-test harness:\\n  - Deterministically run testcases with fixed random seeds where applicable.\\n  - Fail example if runtime exceptions occur (for code tasks).\\n  - Capture flaky tests and rerun up to 2 times to reduce noise; note flakiness separately.\\n- Output normalization utilities:\\n  - Case-insensitive normalize, strip punctuation, normalize Unicode, canonicalize numeric formats.\\n- Forbidden token detection:\\n  - Detect and flag generation of any blacklisted tokens/commands (e.g., \"ssh \", \"curl \", \"rm -rf\", secrets patterns).\\n- Plagiarism/check for training data leakage:\\n  - For sensitive tasks, run simple n-gram overlap against known reference corpora if available. Flag unusually high verbatim overlap.\\n- Semantic similarity checks:\\n  - For open-ended tasks, compute embedding similarity to gold answer to detect major divergence.\\n- Response shape validation:\\n  - Enforce expected JSON/format schema. If model outputs invalid JSON, attempt robust parsing fallback; if impossible, mark as fail.\\n- Execution reproducibility\\n  - Save seed and model parameters used; require runs report the random seed and deterministic flags where used.\\n\\n6) Go/no-go gating rule (prototype → next stage)\\n- Composite gate (all must be met):\\n  1) Automated tests:\\n     - Unit-test (code) average pass-rate >= 50% AND pass@1 >= 40% AND pass@10 >= 70% (or your domain-adjusted values).\\n     - Closed-answer automated exact-match >= 85%.\\n  2) Human-eval:\\n     - Mean human-eval correctness (0/0.5/1) >= 0.75 AND Krippendorff’s alpha >= 0.67 (or Cohen’s kappa >= 0.6).\\n  3) Safety:\\n     - No safety-critical failures in the red-team sample.\\n     - PII detection rate = 0 in evaluated outputs.\\n  4) Latency:\\n     - p95 latency <= 2000 ms (or project-specific SLA).\\n  5) Reliability:\\n     - Flakiness (tests that pass <90% reproducibility across two runs) <= 5% of test cases.\\n- If any single requirement fails, do not promote.

      "  - Automated PII detection: run all outputs through a PII classifier (names, SSNs, credit card patterns, phone numbers, emails, addresses). Any positive detection must flag the example for manual review; for promotion to production, the final system must report PII rate = 0 for allowed prompts.\n",
      "  - Prompt-safety checks: detect attempts to coax the model to reveal training data, personal data, or to execute unsafe instructions.\n",
      "  - Policy gate: Critical: any output that includes user-identifiable PII or clearly disallowed content => fail; do not permit in production.\n",
      "- Sandboxing for code execution (harmless but necessary)\n",
      "  - Execution environment requirements:\n",
      "    - Containerized ephemeral runtime per example (e.g., ephemeral Docker / microVM).\n",
      "    - No network access (disable outbound/inbound).\n",
      "    - No persistent mounts to host FS; only ephemeral in-container FS that will be destroyed after run.\n",
      "    - CPU/memory limits (for example, 2 CPU, 2GB RAM per run) and hard timeouts (e.g., 30s per test case, 60s total per example).\n",
      "    - Disable subprocess/fork privileges, and limit syscalls where possible (seccomp policies).\n",
      "    - Capture stdout/stderr and process exit code.\n",
      "  - Static and dynamic checks:\n",
      "    - Static analyze generated source for forbidden APIs (os.system, subprocess, socket, open with absolute paths, eval/exec, reflection code). If present, mark as unsafe and do not execute; return to human review.\n",
      "    - Dynamic runtime instrumentation to detect network calls, excessive file writes, or spawn of processes — terminate and flag as violation.\n",
      "  - Logging:\n",
      "    - Log execution outputs and resource usage to reproduce results offline; redact any PII before storing logs centrally.\n",
      "- Forbidden operations for DSL/execution\n",
      "  - No network operations\n",
      "  - No direct system-level calls (system, popen) other than allowed safe stdlib for the task\n",

      "  - No calls to external databases/APIs\n",
      "- Safety test harness additions\n",

      "  - Fail example if runtime exceptions occur (for code tasks).\n",
      "  - Capture flaky tests and rerun up to 2 times to reduce noise; note flakiness separately.\n",
      "- Output normalization utilities:\n",
      "  - Case-insensitive normalize, strip punctuation, normalize Unicode, canonicalize numeric formats.\n",
      "- Forbidden token detection:\n",
      "  - Detect and flag generation of any blacklisted tokens/commands (e.g., \"ssh \", \"curl \", \"rm -rf\", secrets patterns).\n",
      "- Plagiarism/check for training data leakage:\n",
      "  - For sensitive tasks, run simple n-gram overlap against known reference corpora if available. Flag unusually high verbatim overlap.\n",
      "- Semantic similarity checks:\n",
      "  - For open-ended tasks, compute embedding similarity to gold answer to detect major divergence.\n",
      "- Response shape validation:\n",
      "  - Enforce expected JSON/format schema. If model outputs invalid JSON, attempt robust parsing fallback; if impossible, mark as fail.\n",
