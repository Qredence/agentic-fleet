# Frontend Documentation Index

This page gathers the Frontend-focused markdowns that live at the repository root and provides a single entry point for engineers working on the React + Vite frontend.

All source documents remain in the repository root to preserve history and discoverability. This index provides convenient links and a recommended reading order.

## Recommended reading order

1. `00_FRONTEND_REVIEW_START_HERE.md` — Quick start for the frontend review process
2. `FRONTEND_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` — Short overview and checklist
3. `FRONTEND_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md` — Visual summary and before/after
4. `FRONTEND_OPTIMIZATION_REVIEW.md` — Detailed technical analysis
5. `FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` — Code examples and step-by-step
6. `FRONTEND_ACTION_PLAN.md` — Timeline and project plan
7. `FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md` — Diagrams and visual references
8. `FRONTEND_REVIEW_DELIVERY.md` — Delivery notes and next steps

## Notes

- These files are intentionally kept at the repository root for easy discovery in PRs and quick edits. If you would like them moved under `docs/frontend/` permanently, open a PR and run `make validate-agents` to ensure relative links and AGENTS docs remain synchronized.
- When editing these docs, prefer relative links (as used above) so previews remain correct for forks and GitHub pages.
