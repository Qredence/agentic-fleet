# Magentic Group Integration – Engineering Report

## Overview
This iteration focused on hardening the FastAPI backend by extracting long-lived resources into structured modules and exposing a composable router surface, while the React client now consumes type-safe API utilities that align with the refreshed contracts. Both stacks share clearer typing and dependency boundaries, paving the way for future persistence and streaming work.

## Backend Enhancements
- **Unified application state container** – introduced `agenticfleet.api.state.BackendState` and stored it on `app.state`, ensuring Redis, workflow factories, WebSocket managers, and background tasks are tracked in one place for predictable shutdown semantics.
- **Router-driven FastAPI surface** – split the monolithic `server.py` into dedicated routers (`routes/system.py`, `routes/chat.py`, `routes/conversations.py`, `routes/approvals.py`, `routes/workflows.py`, `routes/legacy.py`, `routes/placeholders.py`) and registered them through `routes.register_routes` to clarify ownership of each endpoint family.
- **Workflow execution service** – moved execution logic into `services/workflow_executor.py`, preserving streaming semantics while reusing the shared state container to update Redis, emit WebSocket events, and handle timeout/error transitions deterministically.
- **Approval payload typing** – added `api/models/approval.py` to encode the decision contract and reused it across the approval router, keeping modifications and reasons consistent.

## Frontend Enhancements
- **Typed API client** – added `src/frontend/src/lib/api/` with a reusable `apiRequest` helper plus focused modules for chat creation, approval listing/decisions, and health probes. The utility surfaces structured `ApiError` instances for better UX feedback.
- **Shared contract types** – expanded `src/frontend/src/lib/types/` with API-specific interfaces (`ChatExecutionRequest`, `ChatExecutionResponse`, `ApprovalDecisionPayload`, etc.) and re-exported them for hook/component consumption.
- **Hook alignment** – refactored `use-fastapi-chat.ts` to call the new API helpers, normalising error handling, approval submission, and health checks while keeping message streaming logic intact.

## Checkpoints
1. **Backend routing cleanup**
   - Ensure FastAPI app initialises `BackendState`, registers routers, and gracefully tears down Redis/background tasks.
   - Confirm workflow execution uses the shared state and still emits WebSocket events.
2. **Frontend API integration**
   - Replace direct `fetch` calls in `useFastAPIChat` with `apiRequest` helpers for chat execution, approval actions, and health status.
   - Validate new TypeScript interfaces compile via the production Vite build.
3. **Quality gates**
   - Run `make test-config`, `make check`, and `make test` (currently blocked by upstream Git LFS assets).
   - Execute `CI=1 npm run build` to ensure the frontend compiles with updated contracts.

## Verification Results
- `make test-config` – **failed**: uv could not download `agent-framework-azure-ai` due to missing Git LFS object `train_math_agent.png`. (See chunk `416b01`.)
- `make check` – **failed**: uv dependency sync hit the same Git LFS smudge error when fetching `agent-framework-a2a`. (See chunk `00b177`.)
- `make test` – **failed**: identical Git LFS error when resolving `agent-framework-redis`. (See chunk `bad96a`.)
- `CI=1 npm run build` – **passed with Tailwind ambiguity warnings** about `ease-[cubic-bezier(...)]` utilities, matching prior runs. (See chunks `580ad0`, `601bc3`.)

## Next Recommendations
1. Provision the missing agent-framework Git LFS assets (or vendor required wheels) so uv commands can complete in CI.
2. Extend the approval router to emit SSE events when decisions are recorded, enabling the UI to receive live updates.
3. Add integration coverage for the modular routers—unit tests for `create_chat_execution` and approval decisions plus Playwright smoke flows for the chat hook.
4. Explore persisting conversations via Redis using the shared `BackendState` once infrastructure is available.
